    <h2>
      THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new
      clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself
      in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the
      theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him for
      displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the
      day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, &ldquo;he is
      sitting in council,&rdquo; it was always said of him, &ldquo;The Emperor is sitting in
      his wardrobe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers
      arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves
      weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave
      stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes
      manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining
      invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was
      extraordinarily simple in character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!&rdquo; thought the Emperor. &ldquo;Had I
      such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for
      their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish!
      This stuff must be woven for me immediately.&rdquo; And he caused large sums of
      money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their
      work directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very
      busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most
      delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own
      knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms
      until late at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,&rdquo; said
      the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was,
      however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one
      unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure,
      he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would
      prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers,
      and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people
      throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to
      possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their
      neighbors might prove to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,&rdquo; said the Emperor at
      last, after some deliberation, &ldquo;he will be best able to see how the cloth
      looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his
      office than he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were
      working with all their might, at their empty looms. &ldquo;What can be the
      meaning of this?&rdquo; thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. &ldquo;I
      cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.&rdquo; However, he did not
      express his thoughts aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come
      nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and
      whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to
      the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not
      discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was
      nothing there. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; thought he again. &ldquo;Is it possible that I am a
      simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if
      I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be
      said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir Minister!&rdquo; said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.
      &ldquo;You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is excellent!&rdquo; replied the old minister, looking at the loom
      through his spectacles. &ldquo;This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell
      the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be much obliged to you,&rdquo; said the impostors, and then they named
      the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The
      old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might
      repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more silk and
      gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun.
      However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and
      continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty
      looms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were
      getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was
      just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the
      looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the
      minister?&rdquo; asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at the
      same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design
      and colors which were not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am not stupid!&rdquo; thought the messenger. &ldquo;It must be, that I am
      not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no one
      shall know anything about it.&rdquo; And accordingly he praised the stuff he
      could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and
      patterns. &ldquo;Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,&rdquo; said he to his sovereign
      when he returned, &ldquo;the cloth which the weavers are preparing is
      extraordinarily magnificent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had
      ordered to be woven at his own expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it
      was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of the
      court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the
      cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of
      the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever;
      although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the work absolutely magnificent?&rdquo; said the two officers of the
      crown, already mentioned. &ldquo;If your Majesty will only be pleased to look at
      it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!&rdquo; and at the same time
      they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone else
      could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said the Emperor to himself. &ldquo;I can see nothing! This is
      indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an
      Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen&mdash;Oh! the
      cloth is charming,&rdquo; said he, aloud. &ldquo;It has my complete approbation.&rdquo; And
      he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on
      no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of
      his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes,
      hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than
      the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful!&rdquo; and
      advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid
      material, for the approaching procession. &ldquo;Magnificent! Charming!
      Excellent!&rdquo; resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The
      Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors
      with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their
      button-holes, and the title of &ldquo;Gentlemen Weavers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the
      procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that
      everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new suit.
      They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their
      scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; cried
      they, at last. &ldquo;The Emperor's new clothes are ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the
      weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding
      something up, saying, &ldquo;Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the
      scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one
      might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that, however,
      is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed!&rdquo; said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see
      anything of this exquisite manufacture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your
      clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array
      him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side, before
      the looking glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they
      fit!&rdquo; everyone cried out. &ldquo;What a design! What colors! These are indeed
      royal robes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession, is
      waiting,&rdquo; announced the chief master of the ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; answered the Emperor. &ldquo;Do my new clothes fit well?&rdquo;
       asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order
      that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt
      about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle;
      and pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means betray
      anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the
      procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people
      standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, &ldquo;Oh! How beautiful are
      our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to the
      mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!&rdquo; in short, no one would allow
      that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in doing so, he
      would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office.
      Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever made so great an
      impression, as these invisible ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Emperor has nothing at all on!&rdquo; said a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to the voice of innocence!&rdquo; exclaimed his father; and what the
      child had said was whispered from one to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has nothing at all on!&rdquo; at last cried out all the people. The
      Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he thought
      the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber took
      greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in
      reality, there was no train to hold.

    <h2>
      THE SWINEHERD
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very
      small, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter,
      &ldquo;Will you have me?&rdquo; But so he did; for his name was renowned far and wide;
      and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly.&rdquo; We shall see what this princess said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose
      tree&mdash;a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every
      five years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose! It
      smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who
      inhaled its fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a
      manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little
      throat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and
      they were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was
      playing at &ldquo;Visiting,&rdquo; with the ladies of the court; and when she saw the
      caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if it were but a little pussy-cat!&rdquo; said she; but the rose tree, with
      its beautiful rose came to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how prettily it is made!&rdquo; said all the court ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than pretty,&rdquo; said the Emperor, &ldquo;it is charming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, papa!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is not made at all, it is natural!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad humor,&rdquo;
       said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so delightfully
      that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superbe! Charmant!&rdquo; exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to chatter
      French, each one worse than her neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our
      blessed Empress,&rdquo; said an old knight. &ldquo;Oh yes! These are the same tones,
      the same execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will still hope that it is not a real bird,&rdquo; said the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a real bird,&rdquo; said those who had brought it. &ldquo;Well then let
      the bird fly,&rdquo; said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the
      Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and
      black; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day to my lord, the Emperor!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Can I have employment at the
      palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said the Emperor. &ldquo;I want some one to take care of the pigs,
      for we have a great many of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Prince was appointed &ldquo;Imperial Swineherd.&rdquo; He had a dirty little
      room close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By
      the evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were
      hung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in
      the most charming manner, and played the old melody,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Ach! du lieber Augustin,
    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!&rdquo;*

    * &ldquo;Ah! dear Augustine!
    All is gone, gone, gone!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of
      the kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on
      every hearth in the city&mdash;this, you see, was something quite
      different from the rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune,
      she stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play &ldquo;Lieber
      Augustine&rdquo;; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why there is my piece,&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;That swineherd must certainly
      have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So one of the court-ladies must run in; however, she drew on wooden
      slippers first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you take for the kitchen-pot?&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have ten kisses from the Princess,&rdquo; said the swineherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot sell it for less,&rdquo; rejoined the swineherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an impudent fellow!&rdquo; said the Princess, and she walked on; but when
      she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Ach! du lieber Augustin,
    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;Ask him if he will have ten kisses from the
      ladies of my court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo; said the swineherd. &ldquo;Ten kisses from the Princess, or I
      keep the kitchen-pot myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must not be, either!&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;But do you all stand
      before me that no one may see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread out
      their dresses&mdash;the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess&mdash;the
      kitchen-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the whole
      of the following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at every
      fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's; the
      court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, who has
      cutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The swineherd&mdash;that is to say&mdash;the Prince, for no one knew that
      he was other than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without
      working at something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was
      swung round, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been
      heard since the creation of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is superbe!&rdquo; said the Princess when she passed by. &ldquo;I have never
      heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the
      instrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!&rdquo; said the lady who had
      been to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is not in his right senses!&rdquo; said the Princess, and walked on,
      but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. &ldquo;One must encourage
      art,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he shall, as on
      yesterday, have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest from the ladies
      of the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;but we should not like that at all!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;What are you
      muttering?&rdquo; asked the Princess. &ldquo;If I can kiss him, surely you can.
      Remember that you owe everything to me.&rdquo; So the ladies were obliged to go
      to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred kisses from the Princess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or else let everyone keep
      his own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand round!&rdquo; said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the
      kissing was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?&rdquo; said the
      Emperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed his
      eyes, and put on his spectacles. &ldquo;They are the ladies of the court; I must
      go down and see what they are about!&rdquo; So he pulled up his slippers at the
      heel, for he had trodden them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the
      ladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might go
      on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his tiptoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed
      the Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking the
      eighty-sixth kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March out!&rdquo; said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess
      and swineherd were thrust out of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain
      poured down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;If I had but
      married the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color
      from his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his
      princely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help bowing
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to despise thee,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Thou would'st not have an honorable
      Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale, but thou
      wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery plaything.
      Thou art rightly served.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then went back to his own little kingdom, and shut the door of his
      palace in her face. Now she might well sing,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Ach! du lieber Augustin,
    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE REAL PRINCESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she must
      be a real Princess. He travelled all over the world in hopes of finding
      such a lady; but there was always something wrong. Princesses he found in
      plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible for him to
      decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not quite right
      about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite cast down,
      because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the
      rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it was as dark as
      pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and the
      old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain
      and the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water trickled down from her
      hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we shall soon see that!&rdquo; thought the old Queen-mother; however, she
      said not a word of what she was going to do; but went quietly into the
      bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas
      on the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over the
      three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she was asked how she had slept. &ldquo;Oh, very badly indeed!&rdquo;
       she replied. &ldquo;I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night through. I do
      not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard under me, and am all
      over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had been
      able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses and
      twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a
      delicate sense of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he had
      found a real Princess. The three peas were however put into the cabinet of
      curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they are not lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?

    <h2>
      THE SHOES OF FORTUNE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. A Beginning
    </h3>
    <p>
      Every author has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style of
      writing. Those who do not like him, magnify it, shrug up their shoulders,
      and exclaim&mdash;there he is again! I, for my part, know very well how I
      can bring about this movement and this exclamation. It would happen
      immediately if I were to begin here, as I intended to do, with: &ldquo;Rome has
      its Corso, Naples its Toledo&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! that Andersen; there he is
      again!&rdquo; they would cry; yet I must, to please my fancy, continue quite
      quietly, and add: &ldquo;But Copenhagen has its East Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, we will stay for the present. In one of the houses not far
      from the new market a party was invited&mdash;a very large party, in
      order, as is often the case, to get a return invitation from the others.
      One half of the company was already seated at the card-table, the other
      half awaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the
      lady of the house:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had got just so far, and the conversation began to crystallise, as it
      could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace world supplied.
      Amongst other things they spoke of the middle ages: some praised that
      period as far more interesting, far more poetical than our own too sober
      present; indeed Councillor Knap defended this opinion so warmly, that the
      hostess declared immediately on his side, and both exerted themselves with
      unwearied eloquence. The Councillor boldly declared the time of King Hans
      to be the noblest and the most happy period.*
    </p>
    <p>
      * A.D. 1482-1513
    </p>
    <p>
      While the conversation turned on this subject, and was only for a moment
      interrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth
      reading, we will just step out into the antechamber, where cloaks,
      mackintoshes, sticks, umbrellas, and shoes, were deposited. Here sat two
      female figures, a young and an old one. One might have thought at first
      they were servants come to accompany their mistresses home; but on looking
      nearer, one soon saw they could scarcely be mere servants; their forms
      were too noble for that, their skin too fine, the cut of their dress too
      striking. Two fairies were they; the younger, it is true, was not Dame
      Fortune herself, but one of the waiting-maids of her handmaidens who carry
      about the lesser good things that she distributes; the other looked
      extremely gloomy&mdash;it was Care. She always attends to her own serious
      business herself, as then she is sure of having it done properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were telling each other, with a confidential interchange of ideas,
      where they had been during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only
      executed a few unimportant commissions, such as saving a new bonnet from a
      shower of rain, etc.; but what she had yet to perform was something quite
      unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that to-day is my birthday; and in honor of
      it, a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me, which I
      am to carry to mankind. These shoes possess the property of instantly
      transporting him who has them on to the place or the period in which he
      most wishes to be; every wish, as regards time or place, or state of
      being, will be immediately fulfilled, and so at last man will be happy,
      here below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you seriously believe it?&rdquo; replied Care, in a severe tone of reproach.
      &ldquo;No; he will be very unhappy, and will assuredly bless the moment when he
      feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid nonsense!&rdquo; said the other angrily. &ldquo;I will put them here by the
      door. Some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong ones&mdash;he
      will be a happy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. What Happened to the Councillor
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late; Councillor Knap, deeply occupied with the times of King Hans,
      intended to go home, and malicious Fate managed matters so that his feet,
      instead of finding their way to his own galoshes, slipped into those of
      Fortune. Thus caparisoned the good man walked out of the well-lighted
      rooms into East Street. By the magic power of the shoes he was carried
      back to the times of King Hans; on which account his foot very naturally
      sank in the mud and puddles of the street, there having been in those days
      no pavement in Copenhagen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! This is too bad! How dirty it is here!&rdquo; sighed the Councillor. &ldquo;As
      to a pavement, I can find no traces of one, and all the lamps, it seems,
      have gone to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moon was not yet very high; it was besides rather foggy, so that in
      the darkness all objects seemed mingled in chaotic confusion. At the next
      corner hung a votive lamp before a Madonna, but the light it gave was
      little better than none at all; indeed, he did not observe it before he
      was exactly under it, and his eyes fell upon the bright colors of the
      pictures which represented the well-known group of the Virgin and the
      infant Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probably a wax-work show,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;and the people delay
      taking down their sign in hopes of a late visitor or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few persons in the costume of the time of King Hans passed quickly by
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange they look! The good folks come probably from a masquerade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes; the bright blaze of a
      fire shot up from time to time, and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend
      with the bluish light of the torches. The Councillor stood still, and
      watched a most strange procession pass by. First came a dozen drummers,
      who understood pretty well how to handle their instruments; then came
      halberdiers, and some armed with cross-bows. The principal person in the
      procession was a priest. Astonished at what he saw, the Councillor asked
      what was the meaning of all this mummery, and who that man was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the Bishop of Zealand,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! What has taken possession of the Bishop?&rdquo; sighed the
      Councillor, shaking his head. It certainly could not be the Bishop; even
      though he was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom, and
      people told the drollest anecdotes about him. Reflecting on the matter,
      and without looking right or left, the Councillor went through East Street
      and across the Habro-Platz. The bridge leading to Palace Square was not to
      be found; scarcely trusting his senses, the nocturnal wanderer discovered
      a shallow piece of water, and here fell in with two men who very
      comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your honor want to cross the ferry to the Holme?&rdquo; asked they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Across to the Holme!&rdquo; said the Councillor, who knew nothing of the age in
      which he at that moment was. &ldquo;No, I am going to Christianshafen, to Little
      Market Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men stared at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only just tell me where the bridge is,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is really
      unpardonable that there are no lamps here; and it is as dirty as if one
      had to wade through a morass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The longer he spoke with the boatmen, the more unintelligible did their
      language become to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand your Bornholmish dialect,&rdquo; said he at last, angrily,
      and turning his back upon them. He was unable to find the bridge: there
      was no railway either. &ldquo;It is really disgraceful what a state this place
      is in,&rdquo; muttered he to himself. Never had his age, with which, however, he
      was always grumbling, seemed so miserable as on this evening. &ldquo;I'll take a
      hackney-coach!&rdquo; thought he. But where were the hackney-coaches? Not one
      was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go back to the New Market; there, it is to be hoped, I shall find
      some coaches; for if I don't, I shall never get safe to Christianshafen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So off he went in the direction of East Street, and had nearly got to the
      end of it when the moon shone forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me! What wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up
      there?&rdquo; cried he involuntarily, as he looked at East Gate, which, in those
      days, was at the end of East Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found, however, a little side-door open, and through this he went, and
      stepped into our New Market of the present time. It was a huge desolate
      plain; some wild bushes stood up here and there, while across the field
      flowed a broad canal or river. Some wretched hovels for the Dutch sailors,
      resembling great boxes, and after which the place was named, lay about in
      confused disorder on the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I either behold a fata morgana, or I am regularly tipsy,&rdquo; whimpered out
      the Councillor. &ldquo;But what's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round anew, firmly convinced that he was seriously ill. He gazed
      at the street formerly so well known to him, and now so strange in
      appearance, and looked at the houses more attentively: most of them were
      of wood, slightly put together; and many had a thatched roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I am far from well,&rdquo; sighed he; &ldquo;and yet I drank only one glass
      of punch; but I cannot suppose it&mdash;it was, too, really very wrong to
      give us punch and hot salmon for supper. I shall speak about it at the
      first opportunity. I have half a mind to go back again, and say what I
      suffer. But no, that would be too silly; and Heaven only knows if they are
      up still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked for the house, but it had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really dreadful,&rdquo; groaned he with increasing anxiety; &ldquo;I cannot
      recognise East Street again; there is not a single decent shop from one
      end to the other! Nothing but wretched huts can I see anywhere; just as if
      I were at Ringstead. Oh! I am ill! I can scarcely bear myself any longer.
      Where the deuce can the house be? It must be here on this very spot; yet
      there is not the slightest idea of resemblance, to such a degree has
      everything changed this night! At all events here are some people up and
      stirring. Oh! oh! I am certainly very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He now hit upon a half-open door, through a chink of which a faint light
      shone. It was a sort of hostelry of those times; a kind of public-house.
      The room had some resemblance to the clay-floored halls in Holstein; a
      pretty numerous company, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen burghers, and a
      few scholars, sat here in deep converse over their pewter cans, and gave
      little heed to the person who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your leave!&rdquo; said the Councillor to the Hostess, who came bustling
      towards him. &ldquo;I've felt so queer all of a sudden; would you have the
      goodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to Christianshafen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman examined him with eyes of astonishment, and shook her head; she
      then addressed him in German. The Councillor thought she did not
      understand Danish, and therefore repeated his wish in German. This, in
      connection with his costume, strengthened the good woman in the belief
      that he was a foreigner. That he was ill, she comprehended directly; so
      she brought him a pitcher of water, which tasted certainly pretty strong
      of the sea, although it had been fetched from the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Councillor supported his head on his hand, drew a long breath, and
      thought over all the wondrous things he saw around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the Daily News of this evening?&rdquo; he asked mechanically, as he saw
      the Hostess push aside a large sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meaning of this councillorship query remained, of course, a riddle to
      her, yet she handed him the paper without replying. It was a coarse
      wood-cut, representing a splendid meteor &ldquo;as seen in the town of Cologne,&rdquo;
       which was to be read below in bright letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very old!&rdquo; said the Councillor, whom this piece of antiquity
      began to make considerably more cheerful. &ldquo;Pray how did you come into
      possession of this rare print? It is extremely interesting, although the
      whole is a mere fable. Such meteorous appearances are to be explained in
      this way&mdash;that they are the reflections of the Aurora Borealis, and
      it is highly probable they are caused principally by electricity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech, stared at
      him in wonderment; and one of them rose, took off his hat respectfully,
      and said with a serious countenance, &ldquo;You are no doubt a very learned man,
      Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; answered the Councillor, &ldquo;I can only join in conversation on this
      topic and on that, as indeed one must do according to the demands of the
      world at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modestia is a fine virtue,&rdquo; continued the gentleman; &ldquo;however, as to your
      speech, I must say mihi secus videtur: yet I am willing to suspend my
      judicium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask with whom I have the pleasure of speaking?&rdquo; asked the
      Councillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Bachelor in Theologia,&rdquo; answered the gentleman with a stiff
      reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reply fully satisfied the Councillor; the title suited the dress. &ldquo;He
      is certainly,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;some village schoolmaster&mdash;some queer old
      fellow, such as one still often meets with in Jutland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no locus docendi, it is true,&rdquo; began the clerical gentleman; &ldquo;yet
      I beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning. Your reading in the
      ancients is, sine dubio, of vast extent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I've read something, to be sure,&rdquo; replied the Councillor. &ldquo;I like
      reading all useful works; but I do not on that account despise the modern
      ones; 'tis only the unfortunate 'Tales of Every-day Life' that I cannot
      bear&mdash;we have enough and more than enough such in reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tales of Every-day Life?'&rdquo; said our Bachelor inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean those new fangled novels, twisting and writhing themselves in the
      dust of commonplace, which also expect to find a reading public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed the clerical gentleman smiling, &ldquo;there is much wit in
      them; besides they are read at court. The King likes the history of Sir
      Iffven and Sir Gaudian particularly, which treats of King Arthur, and his
      Knights of the Round Table; he has more than once joked about it with his
      high vassals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not read that novel,&rdquo; said the Councillor; &ldquo;it must be quite a new
      one, that Heiberg has published lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the theologian of the time of King Hans: &ldquo;that book is not
      written by a Heiberg, but was imprinted by Godfrey von Gehmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that the author's name?&rdquo; said the Councillor. &ldquo;It is a very old
      name, and, as well as I recollect, he was the first printer that appeared
      in Denmark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is our first printer,&rdquo; replied the clerical gentleman hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far all went on well. Some one of the worthy burghers now spoke of the
      dreadful pestilence that had raged in the country a few years back,
      meaning that of 1484. The Councillor imagined it was the cholera that was
      meant, which people made so much fuss about; and the discourse passed off
      satisfactorily enough. The war of the buccaneers of 1490 was so recent
      that it could not fail being alluded to; the English pirates had, they
      said, most shamefully taken their ships while in the roadstead; and the
      Councillor, before whose eyes the Herostratic [*] event of 1801 still
      floated vividly, agreed entirely with the others in abusing the rascally
      English. With other topics he was not so fortunate; every moment brought
      about some new confusion, and threatened to become a perfect Babel; for
      the worthy Bachelor was really too ignorant, and the simplest observations
      of the Councillor sounded to him too daring and phantastical. They looked
      at one another from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet; and
      when matters grew to too high a pitch, then the Bachelor talked Latin, in
      the hope of being better understood&mdash;but it was of no use after all.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Herostratus, or Eratostratus&mdash;an Ephesian, who wantonly
     set fire to the famous temple of Diana, in order to
     commemorate his name by so uncommon an action.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked the Hostess, plucking the Councillor by the
      sleeve; and now his recollection returned, for in the course of the
      conversation he had entirely forgotten all that had preceded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful God, where am I!&rdquo; exclaimed he in agony; and while he so
      thought, all his ideas and feelings of overpowering dizziness, against
      which he struggled with the utmost power of desperation, encompassed him
      with renewed force. &ldquo;Let us drink claret and mead, and Bremen beer,&rdquo;
       shouted one of the guests&mdash;&ldquo;and you shall drink with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two maidens approached. One wore a cap of two staring colors, denoting the
      class of persons to which she belonged. They poured out the liquor, and
      made the most friendly gesticulations; while a cold perspiration trickled
      down the back of the poor Councillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to be the end of this! What's to become of me!&rdquo; groaned he; but he
      was forced, in spite of his opposition, to drink with the rest. They took
      hold of the worthy man; who, hearing on every side that he was
      intoxicated, did not in the least doubt the truth of this certainly not
      very polite assertion; but on the contrary, implored the ladies and
      gentlemen present to procure him a hackney-coach: they, however, imagined
      he was talking Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before, he thought, had he been in such a coarse and ignorant
      company; one might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again. &ldquo;It
      is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued against
      me!&rdquo; But suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down under the
      table, and then creep unobserved out of the door. He did so; but just as
      he was going, the others remarked what he was about; they laid hold of him
      by the legs; and now, happily for him, off fell his fatal shoes&mdash;and
      with them the charm was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning, and
      behind this a large handsome house. All seemed to him in proper order as
      usual; it was East Street, splendid and elegant as we now see it. He lay
      with his feet towards a doorway, and exactly opposite sat the watchman
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious Heaven!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have I lain here in the street and dreamed?
      Yes; 'tis East Street! How splendid and light it is! But really it is
      terrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later, he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to
      Frederickshafen. He thought of the distress and agony he had endured, and
      praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy reality&mdash;our own
      time&mdash;which, with all its deficiencies, is yet much better than that
      in which, so much against his inclination, he had lately been.
    </p>
    <p>
      III. The Watchman's Adventure
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there is a pair of galoshes, as sure as I'm alive!&rdquo; said the
      watchman, awaking from a gentle slumber. &ldquo;They belong no doubt to the
      lieutenant who lives over the way. They lie close to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house, for
      there was still a light in the window; but he did not like disturbing the
      other people in their beds, and so very considerately he left the matter
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a pair of shoes must be very warm and comfortable,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the
      leather is so soft and supple.&rdquo; They fitted his feet as though they had
      been made for him. &ldquo;'Tis a curious world we live in,&rdquo; continued he,
      soliloquizing. &ldquo;There is the lieutenant, now, who might go quietly to bed
      if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease; but does
      he do it? No; he saunters up and down his room, because, probably, he has
      enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at his dinner. That's a
      happy fellow! He has neither an infirm mother, nor a whole troop of
      everlastingly hungry children to torment him. Every evening he goes to a
      party, where his nice supper costs him nothing: would to Heaven I could
      but change with him! How happy should I be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While expressing his wish, the charm of the shoes, which he had put on,
      began to work; the watchman entered into the being and nature of the
      lieutenant. He stood in the handsomely furnished apartment, and held
      between his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper, on which some
      verses were written&mdash;written indeed by the officer himself; for who
      has not, at least once in his life, had a lyrical moment? And if one then
      marks down one's thoughts, poetry is produced. But here was written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  OH, WERE I RICH!

     &ldquo;Oh, were I rich! Such was my wish, yea such
      When hardly three feet high, I longed for much.
       Oh, were I rich! an officer were I,
       With sword, and uniform, and plume so high.
       And the time came, and officer was I!
     But yet I grew not rich. Alas, poor me!
     Have pity, Thou, who all man's wants dost see.

        &ldquo;I sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss,
      A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss,
       I at that time was rich in poesy
       And tales of old, though poor as poor could be;
       But all she asked for was this poesy.
     Then was I rich, but not in gold, poor me!
     As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.

        &ldquo;Oh, were I rich! Oft asked I for this boon.
      The child grew up to womanhood full soon.
       She is so pretty, clever, and so kind
     Oh, did she know what's hidden in my mind&mdash;
       A tale of old. Would she to me were kind!
     But I'm condemned to silence! oh, poor me!
     As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.

        &ldquo;Oh, were I rich in calm and peace of mind,
      My grief you then would not here written find!
       O thou, to whom I do my heart devote,
       Oh read this page of glad days now remote,
       A dark, dark tale, which I tonight devote!
     Dark is the future now. Alas, poor me!
     Have pity Thou, who all men's pains dost see.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Such verses as these people write when they are in love! But no man in his
      senses ever thinks of printing them. Here one of the sorrows of life, in
      which there is real poetry, gave itself vent; not that barren grief which
      the poet may only hint at, but never depict in its detail&mdash;misery and
      want: that animal necessity, in short, to snatch at least at a fallen leaf
      of the bread-fruit tree, if not at the fruit itself. The higher the
      position in which one finds oneself transplanted, the greater is the
      suffering. Everyday necessity is the stagnant pool of life&mdash;no lovely
      picture reflects itself therein. Lieutenant, love, and lack of money&mdash;that
      is a symbolic triangle, or much the same as the half of the shattered die
      of Fortune. This the lieutenant felt most poignantly, and this was the
      reason he leant his head against the window, and sighed so deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than I. He knows
      not what I term privation. He has a home, a wife, and children, who weep
      with him over his sorrows, who rejoice with him when he is glad. Oh, far
      happier were I, could I exchange with him my being&mdash;with his desires
      and with his hopes perform the weary pilgrimage of life! Oh, he is a
      hundred times happier than I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the same moment the watchman was again watchman. It was the shoes that
      caused the metamorphosis by means of which, unknown to himself, he took
      upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer; but, as we have just
      seen, he felt himself in his new situation much less contented, and now
      preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had rejected. So
      then the watchman was again watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an unpleasant dream,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but 'twas droll enough
      altogether. I fancied that I was the lieutenant over there: and yet the
      thing was not very much to my taste after all. I missed my good old mother
      and the dear little ones; who almost tear me to pieces for sheer love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself once more and nodded: the dream continued to haunt him,
      for he still had the shoes on his feet. A falling star shone in the dark
      firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There falls another star,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;but what does it matter; there are
      always enough left. I should not much mind examining the little glimmering
      things somewhat nearer, especially the moon; for that would not slip so
      easily through a man's fingers. When we die&mdash;so at least says the
      student, for whom my wife does the washing&mdash;we shall fly about as
      light as a feather from one such a star to the other. That's, of course,
      not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so. If I could but once
      take a leap up there, my body might stay here on the steps for what I
      care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behold&mdash;there are certain things in the world to which one ought
      never to give utterance except with the greatest caution; but doubly
      careful must one be when we have the Shoes of Fortune on our feet. Now
      just listen to what happened to the watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to ourselves, we all know the speed produced by the employment of
      steam; we have experienced it either on railroads, or in boats when
      crossing the sea; but such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in
      comparison with the velocity with which light moves. It flies nineteen
      million times faster than the best race-horse; and yet electricity is
      quicker still. Death is an electric shock which our heart receives; the
      freed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity. The sun's light
      wants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than
      twenty million of our Danish [*] miles; borne by electricity, the soul
      wants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight. To it the
      space between the heavenly bodies is not greater than the distance between
      the homes of our friends in town is for us, even if they live a short way
      from each other; such an electric shock in the heart, however, costs us
      the use of the body here below; unless, like the watchman of East Street,
      we happen to have on the Shoes of Fortune.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A Danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 English.
</pre>
    <p>
      In a few seconds the watchman had done the fifty-two thousand of our miles
      up to the moon, which, as everyone knows, was formed out of matter much
      lighter than our earth; and is, so we should say, as soft as newly-fallen
      snow. He found himself on one of the many circumjacent mountain-ridges
      with which we are acquainted by means of Dr. Madler's &ldquo;Map of the Moon.&rdquo;
       Within, down it sunk perpendicularly into a caldron, about a Danish mile
      in depth; while below lay a town, whose appearance we can, in some
      measure, realize to ourselves by beating the white of an egg in a glass of
      water. The matter of which it was built was just as soft, and formed
      similar towers, and domes, and pillars, transparent and rocking in the
      thin air; while above his head our earth was rolling like a large fiery
      ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what we
      call &ldquo;men&rdquo;; yet they looked different to us. A far more correct
      imagination than that of the pseudo-Herschel* had created them; and if
      they had been placed in rank and file, and copied by some skilful
      painter's hand, one would, without doubt, have exclaimed involuntarily,
      &ldquo;What a beautiful arabesque!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      *This relates to a book published some years ago in Germany, and said to
      be by Herschel, which contained a description of the moon and its
      inhabitants, written with such a semblance of truth that many were
      deceived by the imposture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably a translation of the celebrated Moon hoax, written by Richard A.
      Locke, and originally published in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a language too; but surely nobody can expect that the soul of the
      watchman should understand it. Be that as it may, it did comprehend it;
      for in our souls there germinate far greater powers than we poor mortals,
      despite all our cleverness, have any notion of. Does she not show us&mdash;she
      the queen in the land of enchantment&mdash;her astounding dramatic talent
      in all our dreams? There every acquaintance appears and speaks upon the
      stage, so entirely in character, and with the same tone of voice, that
      none of us, when awake, were able to imitate it. How well can she recall
      persons to our mind, of whom we have not thought for years; when suddenly
      they step forth &ldquo;every inch a man,&rdquo; resembling the real personages, even
      to the finest features, and become the heroes or heroines of our world of
      dreams. In reality, such remembrances are rather unpleasant: every sin,
      every evil thought, may, like a clock with alarm or chimes, be repeated at
      pleasure; then the question is if we can trust ourselves to give an
      account of every unbecoming word in our heart and on our lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman's spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the
      moon pretty well. The Selenites* disputed variously about our earth, and
      expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the air, they said, must
      certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller in the moon the
      necessary free respiration. They considered the moon alone to be
      inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or
      planetary system, on which the genuine Cosmopolites, or citizens of the
      world, dwelt. What strange things men&mdash;no, what strange things
      Selenites sometimes take into their heads!
    </p>
    <p>
      * Dwellers in the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      About politics they had a good deal to say. But little Denmark must take
      care what it is about, and not run counter to the moon; that great realm,
      that might in an ill-humor bestir itself, and dash down a hail-storm in
      our faces, or force the Baltic to overflow the sides of its gigantic
      basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will, therefore, not listen to what was spoken, and on no condition run
      in the possibility of telling tales out of school; but we will rather
      proceed, like good quiet citizens, to East Street, and observe what
      happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star,* that is to say, the heavy
      wooden staff, headed with iron spikes, and which had nothing else in
      common with its sparkling brother in the sky, had glided from his hand;
      while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon, looking for the
      good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      *The watchmen in Germany, had formerly, and in some places they still
      carry with them, on their rounds at night, a sort of mace or club, known
      in ancient times by the above denomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the hour, watchman?&rdquo; asked a passer-by. But when the watchman gave
      no reply, the merry roysterer, who was now returning home from a noisy
      drinking bout, took it into his head to try what a tweak of the nose would
      do, on which the supposed sleeper lost his balance, the body lay
      motionless, stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. When the
      patrol came up, all his comrades, who comprehended nothing of the whole
      affair, were seized with a dreadful fright, for dead he was, and he
      remained so. The proper authorities were informed of the circumstance,
      people talked a good deal about it, and in the morning the body was
      carried to the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that would be a very pretty joke, if the spirit when it came back and
      looked for the body in East Street, were not to find one. No doubt it
      would, in its anxiety, run off to the police, and then to the &ldquo;Hue and
      Cry&rdquo; office, to announce that &ldquo;the finder will be handsomely rewarded,&rdquo;
       and at last away to the hospital; yet we may boldly assert that the soul
      is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter, and every sort of
      leading-string&mdash;the body only makes it stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered, as we have said, to the
      hospital, where it was brought into the general viewing-room: and the
      first thing that was done here was naturally to pull off the galoshes&mdash;when
      the spirit, that was merely gone out on adventures, must have returned
      with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement. It took its
      direction towards the body in a straight line; and a few seconds after,
      life began to show itself in the man. He asserted that the preceding night
      had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had allotted him; he would
      not for two silver marks again go through what he had endured while
      moon-stricken; but now, however, it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured; but
      the Shoes meanwhile remained behind.

      IV. A Moment of Head Importance&mdash;An Evening's &ldquo;Dramatic Readings&rdquo;&mdash;A
      Most Strange Journey
    </p>
    <p>
      Every inhabitant of Copenhagen knows, from personal inspection, how the
      entrance to Frederick's Hospital looks; but as it is possible that others,
      who are not Copenhagen people, may also read this little work, we will
      beforehand give a short description of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high
      railing, the thick iron bars of which are so far apart, that in all
      seriousness, it is said, some very thin fellow had of a night occasionally
      squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits in the town. The
      part of the body most difficult to manage on such occasions was, no doubt,
      the head; here, as is so often the case in the world, long-headed people
      get through best. So much, then, for the introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the young men, whose head, in a physical sense only, might be said
      to be of the thickest, had the watch that evening. The rain poured down in
      torrents; yet despite these two obstacles, the young man was obliged to go
      out, if it were but for a quarter of an hour; and as to telling the
      door-keeper about it, that, he thought, was quite unnecessary, if, with a
      whole skin, he were able to slip through the railings. There, on the floor
      lay the galoshes, which the watchman had forgotten; he never dreamed for a
      moment that they were those of Fortune; and they promised to do him good
      service in the wet; so he put them on. The question now was, if he could
      squeeze himself through the grating, for he had never tried before. Well,
      there he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven I had got my head through!&rdquo; said he, involuntarily; and
      instantly through it slipped, easily and without pain, notwithstanding it
      was pretty large and thick. But now the rest of the body was to be got
      through!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am much too stout,&rdquo; groaned he aloud, while fixed as in a vice. &ldquo;I
      had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matter&mdash;oh!
      oh! I really cannot squeeze myself through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He now wanted to pull his over-hasty head back again, but he could not.
      For his neck there was room enough, but for nothing more. His first
      feeling was of anger; his next that his temper fell to zero. The Shoes of
      Fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation; and, unfortunately,
      it never occurred to him to wish himself free. The pitch-black clouds
      poured down their contents in still heavier torrents; not a creature was
      to be seen in the streets. To reach up to the bell was what he did not
      like; to cry aloud for help would have availed him little; besides, how
      ashamed would he have been to be found caught in a trap, like an outwitted
      fox! How was he to twist himself through! He saw clearly that it was his
      irrevocable destiny to remain a prisoner till dawn, or, perhaps, even late
      in the morning; then the smith must be fetched to file away the bars; but
      all that would not be done so quickly as he could think about it. The
      whole Charity School, just opposite, would be in motion; all the new
      booths, with their not very courtier-like swarm of seamen, would join them
      out of curiosity, and would greet him with a wild &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; while he was
      standing in his pillory: there would be a mob, a hissing, and rejoicing,
      and jeering, ten times worse than in the rows about the Jews some years
      ago&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my blood is mounting to my brain; 'tis enough to drive one
      mad! I shall go wild! I know not what to do. Oh! were I but loose; my
      dizziness would then cease; oh, were my head but loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You see he ought to have said that sooner; for the moment he expressed the
      wish his head was free; and cured of all his paroxysms of love, he
      hastened off to his room, where the pains consequent on the fright the
      Shoes had prepared for him, did not so soon take their leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you must not think that the affair is over now; it grows much worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed, the next day also; but nobody came to fetch the Shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening &ldquo;Dramatic Readings&rdquo; were to be given at the little theatre
      in King Street. The house was filled to suffocation; and among other
      pieces to be recited was a new poem by H. C. Andersen, called, My Aunt's
      Spectacles; the contents of which were pretty nearly as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain person had an aunt, who boasted of particular skill in
      fortune-telling with cards, and who was constantly being stormed by
      persons that wanted to have a peep into futurity. But she was full of
      mystery about her art, in which a certain pair of magic spectacles did her
      essential service. Her nephew, a merry boy, who was his aunt's darling,
      begged so long for these spectacles, that, at last, she lent him the
      treasure, after having informed him, with many exhortations, that in order
      to execute the interesting trick, he need only repair to some place where
      a great many persons were assembled; and then, from a higher position,
      whence he could overlook the crowd, pass the company in review before him
      through his spectacles. Immediately 'the inner man' of each individual
      would be displayed before him, like a game of cards, in which he
      unerringly might read what the future of every person presented was to be.
      Well pleased the little magician hastened away to prove the powers of the
      spectacles in the theatre; no place seeming to him more fitted for such a
      trial. He begged permission of the worthy audience, and set his spectacles
      on his nose. A motley phantasmagoria presents itself before him, which he
      describes in a few satirical touches, yet without expressing his opinion
      openly: he tells the people enough to set them all thinking and guessing;
      but in order to hurt nobody, he wraps his witty oracular judgments in a
      transparent veil, or rather in a lurid thundercloud, shooting forth bright
      sparks of wit, that they may fall in the powder-magazine of the expectant
      audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The humorous poem was admirably recited, and the speaker much applauded.
      Among the audience was the young man of the hospital, who seemed to have
      forgotten his adventure of the preceding night. He had on the Shoes; for
      as yet no lawful owner had appeared to claim them; and besides it was so
      very dirty out-of-doors, they were just the thing for him, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of the poem he praised with great generosity: he even found
      the idea original and effective. But that the end of it, like the Rhine,
      was very insignificant, proved, in his opinion, the author's want of
      invention; he was without genius, etc. This was an excellent opportunity
      to have said something clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he was haunted by the idea&mdash;he should like to possess such
      a pair of spectacles himself; then, perhaps, by using them circumspectly,
      one would be able to look into people's hearts, which, he thought, would
      be far more interesting than merely to see what was to happen next year;
      for that we should all know in proper time, but the other never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can now,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;fancy the whole row of ladies and
      gentlemen sitting there in the front row; if one could but see into their
      hearts&mdash;yes, that would be a revelation&mdash;a sort of bazar. In
      that lady yonder, so strangely dressed, I should find for certain a large
      milliner's shop; in that one the shop is empty, but it wants cleaning
      plain enough. But there would also be some good stately shops among them.
      Alas!&rdquo; sighed he, &ldquo;I know one in which all is stately; but there sits
      already a spruce young shopman, which is the only thing that's amiss in
      the whole shop. All would be splendidly decked out, and we should hear,
      'Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in; here you will find all you please to
      want.' Ah! I wish to Heaven I could walk in and take a trip right through
      the hearts of those present!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And behold! to the Shoes of Fortune this was the cue; the whole man shrunk
      together and a most uncommon journey through the hearts of the front row
      of spectators, now began. The first heart through which he came, was that
      of a middle-aged lady, but he instantly fancied himself in the room of the
      &ldquo;Institution for the cure of the crooked and deformed,&rdquo; where casts of
      mis-shapen limbs are displayed in naked reality on the wall. Yet there was
      this difference, in the institution the casts were taken at the entry of
      the patient; but here they were retained and guarded in the heart while
      the sound persons went away. They were, namely, casts of female friends,
      whose bodily or mental deformities were here most faithfully preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the snake-like writhings of an idea he glided into another female
      heart; but this seemed to him like a large holy fane. [*] The white dove
      of innocence fluttered over the altar. How gladly would he have sunk upon
      his knees; but he must away to the next heart; yet he still heard the
      pealing tones of the organ, and he himself seemed to have become a newer
      and a better man; he felt unworthy to tread the neighboring sanctuary
      which a poor garret, with a sick bed-rid mother, revealed. But God's warm
      sun streamed through the open window; lovely roses nodded from the wooden
      flower-boxes on the roof, and two sky-blue birds sang rejoicingly, while
      the sick mother implored God's richest blessings on her pious daughter.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * temple
</pre>
    <p>
      He now crept on hands and feet through a butcher's shop; at least on every
      side, and above and below, there was nought but flesh. It was the heart of
      a most respectable rich man, whose name is certain to be found in the
      Directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman. It was an
      old, dilapidated, mouldering dovecot. The husband's portrait was used as a
      weather-cock, which was connected in some way or other with the doors, and
      so they opened and shut of their own accord, whenever the stern old
      husband turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon he wandered into a boudoir formed entirely of mirrors, like the
      one in Castle Rosenburg; but here the glasses magnified to an astonishing
      degree. On the floor, in the middle of the room, sat, like a Dalai-Lama,
      the insignificant &ldquo;Self&rdquo; of the person, quite confounded at his own
      greatness. He then imagined he had got into a needle-case full of pointed
      needles of every size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is certainly the heart of an old maid,&rdquo; thought he. But he was
      mistaken. It was the heart of a young military man; a man, as people said,
      of talent and feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the greatest perplexity, he now came out of the last heart in the row;
      he was unable to put his thoughts in order, and fancied that his too
      lively imagination had run away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; sighed he. &ldquo;I have surely a disposition to madness&mdash;'tis
      dreadfully hot here; my blood boils in my veins and my head is burning
      like a coal.&rdquo; And he now remembered the important event of the evening
      before, how his head had got jammed in between the iron railings of the
      hospital. &ldquo;That's what it is, no doubt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I must do something in
      time: under such circumstances a Russian bath might do me good. I only
      wish I were already on the upper bank.&rdquo; [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *In these Russian (vapor) baths the person extends himself
     on a bank or form, and as he gets accustomed to the heat,
     moves to another higher up towards the ceiling, where, of
     course, the vapor is warmest. In this manner he ascends
     gradually to the highest.
</pre>
    <p>
      And so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor-bath; but with all
      his clothes on, in his boots and galoshes, while the hot drops fell
      scalding from the ceiling on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; cried he, leaping down. The bathing attendant, on his side,
      uttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath, a man
      completely dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, however, retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to
      him, &ldquo;'Tis a bet, and I have won it!&rdquo; But the first thing he did as soon
      as he got home, was to have a large blister put on his chest and back to
      draw out his madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back; and, excepting
      the fright, that was all that he had gained by the Shoes of Fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. Metamorphosis of the Copying-Clerk
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman, whom we have certainly not forgotten, thought meanwhile of
      the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital; he now went
      to fetch them; and as neither the lieutenant, nor anybody else in the
      street, claimed them as his property, they were delivered over to the
      police-office.*
    </p>
    <p>
      *As on the continent, in all law and police practices nothing is verbal,
      but any circumstance, however trifling, is reduced to writing, the labor,
      as well as the number of papers that thus accumulate, is enormous. In a
      police-office, consequently, we find copying-clerks among many other
      scribes of various denominations, of which, it seems, our hero was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I declare the Shoes look just like my own,&rdquo; said one of the clerks,
      eying the newly-found treasure, whose hidden powers, even he, sharp as he
      was, was not able to discover. &ldquo;One must have more than the eye of a
      shoemaker to know one pair from the other,&rdquo; said he, soliloquizing; and
      putting, at the same time, the galoshes in search of an owner, beside his
      own in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sir!&rdquo; said one of the men, who panting brought him a tremendous
      pile of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man about the
      reports and legal documents in question; but when he had finished, and his
      eye fell again on the Shoes, he was unable to say whether those to the
      left or those to the right belonged to him. &ldquo;At all events it must be
      those which are wet,&rdquo; thought he; but this time, in spite of his
      cleverness, he guessed quite wrong, for it was just those of Fortune which
      played as it were into his hands, or rather on his feet. And why, I should
      like to know, are the police never to be wrong? So he put them on quickly,
      stuck his papers in his pocket, and took besides a few under his arm,
      intending to look them through at home to make the necessary notes. It was
      noon; and the weather, that had threatened rain, began to clear up, while
      gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. &ldquo;A little trip to
      Fredericksburg would do me no great harm,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;for I, poor beast
      of burden that I am, have so much to annoy me, that I don't know what a
      good appetite is. 'Tis a bitter crust, alas! at which I am condemned to
      gnaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody could be more steady or quiet than this young man; we therefore
      wish him joy of the excursion with all our heart; and it will certainly be
      beneficial for a person who leads so sedentary a life. In the park he met
      a friend, one of our young poets, who told him that the following day he
      should set out on his long-intended tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going away again!&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;You are a very free and
      happy being; we others are chained by the leg and held fast to our desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it is a chain, friend, which ensures you the blessed bread of
      existence,&rdquo; answered the poet. &ldquo;You need feel no care for the coming
      morrow: when you are old, you receive a pension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the clerk, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;and yet you are the
      better off. To sit at one's ease and poetise&mdash;that is a pleasure;
      everybody has something agreeable to say to you, and you are always your
      own master. No, friend, you should but try what it is to sit from one
      year's end to the other occupied with and judging the most trivial
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poet shook his head, the copying-clerk did the same. Each one kept to
      his own opinion, and so they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a strange race, those poets!&rdquo; said the clerk, who was very fond of
      soliloquizing. &ldquo;I should like some day, just for a trial, to take such
      nature upon me, and be a poet myself; I am very sure I should make no such
      miserable verses as the others. Today, methinks, is a most delicious day
      for a poet. Nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening into life. The
      air is so unusually clear, the clouds sail on so buoyantly, and from the
      green herbage a fragrance is exhaled that fills me with delight. For many
      a year have I not felt as at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We see already, by the foregoing effusion, that he is become a poet; to
      give further proof of it, however, would in most cases be insipid, for it
      is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from other men. Among
      the latter there may be far more poetical natures than many an
      acknowledged poet, when examined more closely, could boast of; the
      difference only is, that the poet possesses a better mental memory, on
      which account he is able to retain the feeling and the thought till they
      can be embodied by means of words; a faculty which the others do not
      possess. But the transition from a commonplace nature to one that is
      richly endowed, demands always a more or less breakneck leap over a
      certain abyss which yawns threateningly below; and thus must the sudden
      change with the clerk strike the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sweet air!&rdquo; continued he of the police-office, in his dreamy
      imaginings; &ldquo;how it reminds me of the violets in the garden of my aunt
      Magdalena! Yes, then I was a little wild boy, who did not go to school
      very regularly. O heavens! 'tis a long time since I have thought on those
      times. The good old soul! She lived behind the Exchange. She always had a
      few twigs or green shoots in water&mdash;let the winter rage without as it
      might. The violets exhaled their sweet breath, whilst I pressed against
      the windowpanes covered with fantastic frost-work the copper coin I had
      heated on the stove, and so made peep-holes. What splendid vistas were
      then opened to my view! What change&mdash;what magnificence! Yonder in the
      canal lay the ships frozen up, and deserted by their whole crews, with a
      screaming crow for the sole occupant. But when the spring, with a gentle
      stirring motion, announced her arrival, a new and busy life arose; with
      songs and hurrahs the ice was sawn asunder, the ships were fresh tarred
      and rigged, that they might sail away to distant lands. But I have
      remained here&mdash;must always remain here, sitting at my desk in the
      office, and patiently see other people fetch their passports to go abroad.
      Such is my fate! Alas!&rdquo;&mdash;sighed he, and was again silent. &ldquo;Great
      Heaven! What is come to me! Never have I thought or felt like this before!
      It must be the summer air that affects me with feelings almost as
      disquieting as they are refreshing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pocket for the papers. &ldquo;These police-reports will soon stem
      the torrent of my ideas, and effectually hinder any rebellious overflowing
      of the time-worn banks of official duties&rdquo;; he said to himself
      consolingly, while his eye ran over the first page. &ldquo;DAME TIGBRITH,
      tragedy in five acts.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is that? And yet it is undeniably my own
      handwriting. Have I written the tragedy? Wonderful, very wonderful!&mdash;And
      this&mdash;what have I here? 'INTRIGUE ON THE RAMPARTS; or THE DAY OF
      REPENTANCE: vaudeville with new songs to the most favorite airs.' The
      deuce! Where did I get all this rubbish? Some one must have slipped it
      slyly into my pocket for a joke. There is too a letter to me; a crumpled
      letter and the seal broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes; it was not a very polite epistle from the manager of a theatre, in
      which both pieces were flatly refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem! hem!&rdquo; said the clerk breathlessly, and quite exhausted he seated
      himself on a bank. His thoughts were so elastic, his heart so tender; and
      involuntarily he picked one of the nearest flowers. It is a simple daisy,
      just bursting out of the bud. What the botanist tells us after a number of
      imperfect lectures, the flower proclaimed in a minute. It related the
      mythus of its birth, told of the power of the sun-light that spread out
      its delicate leaves, and forced them to impregnate the air with their
      incense&mdash;and then he thought of the manifold struggles of life, which
      in like manner awaken the budding flowers of feeling in our bosom. Light
      and air contend with chivalric emulation for the love of the fair flower
      that bestowed her chief favors on the latter; full of longing she turned
      towards the light, and as soon as it vanished, rolled her tender leaves
      together and slept in the embraces of the air. &ldquo;It is the light which
      adorns me,&rdquo; said the flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But 'tis the air which enables thee to breathe,&rdquo; said the poet's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. The drops of
      water splashed up to the green leafy roof, and the clerk thought of the
      million of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height,
      that was as great doubtless for their size, as for us if we were to be
      hurled above the clouds. While he thought of this and of the whole
      metamorphosis he had undergone, he smiled and said, &ldquo;I sleep and dream;
      but it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally, and know besides so
      exactly that it is but a dream. If only to-morrow on awaking, I could
      again call all to mind so vividly! I seem in unusually good spirits; my
      perception of things is clear, I feel as light and cheerful as though I
      were in heaven; but I know for a certainty, that if to-morrow a dim
      remembrance of it should swim before my mind, it will then seem nothing
      but stupid nonsense, as I have often experienced already&mdash;especially
      before I enlisted under the banner of the police, for that dispels like a
      whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination. All we hear or say
      in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the subterranean
      spirits; it is rich and splendid when it is given us, but viewed by
      daylight we find only withered leaves. Alas!&rdquo; he sighed quite sorrowful,
      and gazed at the chirping birds that hopped contentedly from branch to
      branch, &ldquo;they are much better off than I! To fly must be a heavenly art;
      and happy do I prize that creature in which it is innate. Yes! Could I
      exchange my nature with any other creature, I fain would be such a happy
      little lark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly uttered these hasty words when the skirts and sleeves of his
      coat folded themselves together into wings; the clothes became feathers,
      and the galoshes claws. He observed it perfectly, and laughed in his
      heart. &ldquo;Now then, there is no doubt that I am dreaming; but I never before
      was aware of such mad freaks as these.&rdquo; And up he flew into the green roof
      and sang; but in the song there was no poetry, for the spirit of the poet
      was gone. The Shoes, as is the case with anybody who does what he has to
      do properly, could only attend to one thing at a time. He wanted to be a
      poet, and he was one; he now wished to be a merry chirping bird: but when
      he was metamorphosed into one, the former peculiarities ceased
      immediately. &ldquo;It is really pleasant enough,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;the whole day long
      I sit in the office amid the driest law-papers, and at night I fly in my
      dream as a lark in the gardens of Fredericksburg; one might really write a
      very pretty comedy upon it.&rdquo; He now fluttered down into the grass, turned
      his head gracefully on every side, and with his bill pecked the pliant
      blades of grass, which, in comparison to his present size, seemed as
      majestic as the palm-branches of northern Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment. Presently black night
      overshadowed our enthusiast, who had so entirely missed his part of
      copying-clerk at a police-office; some vast object seemed to be thrown
      over him. It was a large oil-skin cap, which a sailor-boy of the quay had
      thrown over the struggling bird; a coarse hand sought its way carefully in
      under the broad rim, and seized the clerk over the back and wings. In the
      first moment of fear, he called, indeed, as loud as he could&mdash;&ldquo;You
      impudent little blackguard! I am a copying-clerk at the police-office; and
      you know you cannot insult any belonging to the constabulary force without
      a chastisement. Besides, you good-for-nothing rascal, it is strictly
      forbidden to catch birds in the royal gardens of Fredericksburg; but your
      blue uniform betrays where you come from.&rdquo; This fine tirade sounded,
      however, to the ungodly sailor-boy like a mere &ldquo;Pippi-pi.&rdquo; He gave the
      noisy bird a knock on his beak, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon met by two schoolboys of the upper class&mdash;that is to say
      as individuals, for with regard to learning they were in the lowest class
      in the school; and they bought the stupid bird. So the copying-clerk came
      to Copenhagen as guest, or rather as prisoner in a family living in Gother
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well that I'm dreaming,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;or I really should get
      angry. First I was a poet; now sold for a few pence as a lark; no doubt it
      was that accursed poetical nature which has metamorphosed me into such a
      poor harmless little creature. It is really pitiable, particularly when
      one gets into the hands of a little blackguard, perfect in all sorts of
      cruelty to animals: all I should like to know is, how the story will end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two schoolboys, the proprietors now of the transformed clerk, carried
      him into an elegant room. A stout stately dame received them with a smile;
      but she expressed much dissatisfaction that a common field-bird, as she
      called the lark, should appear in such high society. For to-day, however,
      she would allow it; and they must shut him in the empty cage that was
      standing in the window. &ldquo;Perhaps he will amuse my good Polly,&rdquo; added the
      lady, looking with a benignant smile at a large green parrot that swung
      himself backwards and forwards most comfortably in his ring, inside a
      magnificent brass-wired cage. &ldquo;To-day is Polly's birthday,&rdquo; said she with
      stupid simplicity: &ldquo;and the little brown field-bird must wish him joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Polly uttered not a syllable in reply, but swung to and fro with
      dignified condescension; while a pretty canary, as yellow as gold, that
      had lately been brought from his sunny fragrant home, began to sing aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noisy creature! Will you be quiet!&rdquo; screamed the lady of the house,
      covering the cage with an embroidered white pocket handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chirp, chirp!&rdquo; sighed he. &ldquo;That was a dreadful snowstorm&rdquo;; and he sighed
      again, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The copying-clerk, or, as the lady said, the brown field-bird, was put
      into a small cage, close to the Canary, and not far from &ldquo;my good Polly.&rdquo;
       The only human sounds that the Parrot could bawl out were, &ldquo;Come, let us
      be men!&rdquo; Everything else that he said was as unintelligible to everybody
      as the chirping of the Canary, except to the clerk, who was now a bird
      too: he understood his companion perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flew about beneath the green palms and the blossoming almond-trees,&rdquo;
       sang the Canary; &ldquo;I flew around, with my brothers and sisters, over the
      beautiful flowers, and over the glassy lakes, where the bright
      water-plants nodded to me from below. There, too, I saw many
      splendidly-dressed paroquets, that told the drollest stories, and the
      wildest fairy tales without end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! those were uncouth birds,&rdquo; answered the Parrot. &ldquo;They had no
      education, and talked of whatever came into their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my mistress and all her friends can laugh at what I say, so may you
      too, I should think. It is a great fault to have no taste for what is
      witty or amusing&mdash;come, let us be men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have no remembrance of love for the charming maidens that danced
      beneath the outspread tents beside the bright fragrant flowers? Do you no
      longer remember the sweet fruits, and the cooling juice in the wild plants
      of our never-to-be-forgotten home?&rdquo; said the former inhabitant of the
      Canary Isles, continuing his dithyrambic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the Parrot; &ldquo;but I am far better off here. I am well fed,
      and get friendly treatment. I know I am a clever fellow; and that is all I
      care about. Come, let us be men. You are of a poetical nature, as it is
      called&mdash;I, on the contrary, possess profound knowledge and
      inexhaustible wit. You have genius; but clear-sighted, calm discretion
      does not take such lofty flights, and utter such high natural tones. For
      this they have covered you over&mdash;they never do the like to me; for I
      cost more. Besides, they are afraid of my beak; and I have always a witty
      answer at hand. Come, let us be men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O warm spicy land of my birth,&rdquo; sang the Canary bird; &ldquo;I will sing of thy
      dark-green bowers, of the calm bays where the pendent boughs kiss the
      surface of the water; I will sing of the rejoicing of all my brothers and
      sisters where the cactus grows in wanton luxuriance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare us your elegiac tones,&rdquo; said the Parrot giggling. &ldquo;Rather speak of
      something at which one may laugh heartily. Laughing is an infallible sign
      of the highest degree of mental development. Can a dog, or a horse laugh?
      No, but they can cry. The gift of laughing was given to man alone. Ha! ha!
      ha!&rdquo; screamed Polly, and added his stereotype witticism. &ldquo;Come, let us be
      men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Danish grey-bird,&rdquo; said the Canary; &ldquo;you have been caught
      too. It is, no doubt, cold enough in your woods, but there at least is the
      breath of liberty; therefore fly away. In the hurry they have forgotten to
      shut your cage, and the upper window is open. Fly, my friend; fly away.
      Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively the Clerk obeyed; with a few strokes of his wings he was out
      of the cage; but at the same moment the door, which was only ajar, and
      which led to the next room, began to creak, and supple and creeping came
      the large tomcat into the room, and began to pursue him. The frightened
      Canary fluttered about in his cage; the Parrot flapped his wings, and
      cried, &ldquo;Come, let us be men!&rdquo; The Clerk felt a mortal fright, and flew
      through the window, far away over the houses and streets. At last he was
      forced to rest a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighboring house had a something familiar about it; a window stood
      open; he flew in; it was his own room. He perched upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us be men!&rdquo; said he, involuntarily imitating the chatter of the
      Parrot, and at the same moment he was again a copying-clerk; but he was
      sitting in the middle of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven help me!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;How did I get up here&mdash;and so buried in
      sleep, too? After all, that was a very unpleasant, disagreeable dream that
      haunted me! The whole story is nothing but silly, stupid nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VI. The Best That the Galoshes Gave
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day, early in the morning, while the Clerk was still in bed,
      someone knocked at his door. It was his neighbor, a young Divine, who
      lived on the same floor. He walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me your Galoshes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is so wet in the garden, though the
      sun is shining most invitingly. I should like to go out a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got the Galoshes, and he was soon below in a little duodecimo garden,
      where between two immense walls a plumtree and an apple-tree were
      standing. Even such a little garden as this was considered in the
      metropolis of Copenhagen as a great luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man wandered up and down the narrow paths, as well as the
      prescribed limits would allow; the clock struck six; without was heard the
      horn of a post-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To travel! to travel!&rdquo; exclaimed he, overcome by most painful and
      passionate remembrances. &ldquo;That is the happiest thing in the world! That is
      the highest aim of all my wishes! Then at last would the agonizing
      restlessness be allayed, which destroys my existence! But it must be far,
      far away! I would behold magnificent Switzerland; I would travel to Italy,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a good thing that the power of the Galoshes worked as
      instantaneously as lightning in a powder-magazine would do, otherwise the
      poor man with his overstrained wishes would have travelled about the world
      too much for himself as well as for us. In short, he was travelling. He
      was in the middle of Switzerland, but packed up with eight other
      passengers in the inside of an eternally-creaking diligence; his head
      ached till it almost split, his weary neck could hardly bear the heavy
      load, and his feet, pinched by his torturing boots, were terribly swollen.
      He was in an intermediate state between sleeping and waking; at variance
      with himself, with his company, with the country, and with the government.
      In his right pocket he had his letter of credit, in the left, his
      passport, and in a small leathern purse some double louis d'or, carefully
      sewn up in the bosom of his waistcoat. Every dream proclaimed that one or
      the other of these valuables was lost; wherefore he started up as in a
      fever; and the first movement which his hand made, described a magic
      triangle from the right pocket to the left, and then up towards the bosom,
      to feel if he had them all safe or not. From the roof inside the carriage,
      umbrellas, walking-sticks, hats, and sundry other articles were depending,
      and hindered the view, which was particularly imposing. He now endeavored
      as well as he was able to dispel his gloom, which was caused by outward
      chance circumstances merely, and on the bosom of nature imbibe the milk of
      purest human enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grand, solemn, and dark was the whole landscape around. The gigantic
      pine-forests, on the pointed crags, seemed almost like little tufts of
      heather, colored by the surrounding clouds. It began to snow, a cold wind
      blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augh!&rdquo; sighed he, &ldquo;were we only on the other side the Alps, then we
      should have summer, and I could get my letters of credit cashed. The
      anxiety I feel about them prevents me enjoying Switzerland. Were I but on
      the other side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying he was on the other side in Italy, between Florence and
      Rome. Lake Thracymene, illumined by the evening sun, lay like flaming gold
      between the dark-blue mountain-ridges; here, where Hannibal defeated
      Flaminius, the rivers now held each other in their green embraces; lovely,
      half-naked children tended a herd of black swine, beneath a group of
      fragrant laurel-trees, hard by the road-side. Could we render this
      inimitable picture properly, then would everybody exclaim, &ldquo;Beautiful,
      unparalleled Italy!&rdquo; But neither the young Divine said so, nor anyone of
      his grumbling companions in the coach of the vetturino.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poisonous flies and gnats swarmed around by thousands; in vain one
      waved myrtle-branches about like mad; the audacious insect population did
      not cease to sting; nor was there a single person in the well-crammed
      carriage whose face was not swollen and sore from their ravenous bites.
      The poor horses, tortured almost to death, suffered most from this truly
      Egyptian plague; the flies alighted upon them in large disgusting swarms;
      and if the coachman got down and scraped them off, hardly a minute elapsed
      before they were there again. The sun now set: a freezing cold, though of
      short duration pervaded the whole creation; it was like a horrid gust
      coming from a burial-vault on a warm summer's day&mdash;but all around the
      mountains retained that wonderful green tone which we see in some old
      pictures, and which, should we not have seen a similar play of color in
      the South, we declare at once to be unnatural. It was a glorious prospect;
      but the stomach was empty, the body tired; all that the heart cared and
      longed for was good night-quarters; yet how would they be? For these one
      looked much more anxiously than for the charms of nature, which every
      where were so profusely displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road led through an olive-grove, and here the solitary inn was
      situated. Ten or twelve crippled-beggars had encamped outside. The
      healthiest of them resembled, to use an expression of Marryat's, &ldquo;Hunger's
      eldest son when he had come of age&rdquo;; the others were either blind, had
      withered legs and crept about on their hands, or withered arms and
      fingerless hands. It was the most wretched misery, dragged from among the
      filthiest rags. &ldquo;Excellenza, miserabili!&rdquo; sighed they, thrusting forth
      their deformed limbs to view. Even the hostess, with bare feet, uncombed
      hair, and dressed in a garment of doubtful color, received the guests
      grumblingly. The doors were fastened with a loop of string; the floor of
      the rooms presented a stone paving half torn up; bats fluttered wildly
      about the ceiling; and as to the smell therein&mdash;no&mdash;that was
      beyond description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better lay the cloth below in the stable,&rdquo; said one of the
      travellers; &ldquo;there, at all events, one knows what one is breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The windows were quickly opened, to let in a little fresh air. Quicker,
      however, than the breeze, the withered, sallow arms of the beggars were
      thrust in, accompanied by the eternal whine of &ldquo;Miserabili, miserabili,
      excellenza!&rdquo; On the walls were displayed innumerable inscriptions, written
      in nearly every language of Europe, some in verse, some in prose, most of
      them not very laudatory of &ldquo;bella Italia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meal was served. It consisted of a soup of salted water, seasoned with
      pepper and rancid oil. The last ingredient played a very prominent part in
      the salad; stale eggs and roasted cocks'-combs furnished the grand dish of
      the repast; the wine even was not without a disgusting taste&mdash;it was
      like a medicinal draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night the boxes and other effects of the passengers were placed against
      the rickety doors. One of the travellers kept watch while the others
      slept. The sentry was our young Divine. How close it was in the chamber!
      The heat oppressive to suffocation&mdash;the gnats hummed and stung
      unceasingly&mdash;the &ldquo;miserabili&rdquo; without whined and moaned in their
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Travelling would be agreeable enough,&rdquo; said he groaning, &ldquo;if one only had
      no body, or could send it to rest while the spirit went on its pilgrimage
      unhindered, whither the voice within might call it. Wherever I go, I am
      pursued by a longing that is insatiable&mdash;that I cannot explain to
      myself, and that tears my very heart. I want something better than what is
      but what is fled in an instant. But what is it, and where is it to be
      found? Yet, I know in reality what it is I wish for. Oh! most happy were
      I, could I but reach one aim&mdash;could but reach the happiest of all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke the word he was again in his home; the long white curtains
      hung down from the windows, and in the middle of the floor stood the black
      coffin; in it he lay in the sleep of death. His wish was fulfilled&mdash;the
      body rested, while the spirit went unhindered on its pilgrimage. &ldquo;Let no
      one deem himself happy before his end,&rdquo; were the words of Solon; and here
      was a new and brilliant proof of the wisdom of the old apothegm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every corpse is a sphynx of immortality; here too on the black coffin the
      sphynx gave us no answer to what he who lay within had written two days
      before:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O mighty Death! thy silence teaches nought,
       Thou leadest only to the near grave's brink;
      Is broken now the ladder of my thoughts?
     Do I instead of mounting only sink?

     Our heaviest grief the world oft seeth not,
      Our sorest pain we hide from stranger eyes:
      And for the sufferer there is nothing left
     But the green mound that o'er the coffin lies.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Two figures were moving in the chamber. We knew them both; it was the
      fairy of Care, and the emissary of Fortune. They both bent over the
      corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you now see,&rdquo; said Care, &ldquo;what happiness your Galoshes have brought to
      mankind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him, at least, who slumbers here, they have brought an imperishable
      blessing,&rdquo; answered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah no!&rdquo; replied Care. &ldquo;He took his departure himself; he was not called
      away. His mental powers here below were not strong enough to reach the
      treasures lying beyond this life, and which his destiny ordained he should
      obtain. I will now confer a benefit on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she took the Galoshes from his feet; his sleep of death was ended; and
      he who had been thus called back again to life arose from his dread couch
      in all the vigor of youth. Care vanished, and with her the Galoshes. She
      has no doubt taken them for herself, to keep them to all eternity.

    <h2>
      THE FIR TREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a very
      good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough of that,
      and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs. But
      the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care for
      the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in
      the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came with a
      whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on a straw,
      and sat down near the young tree and said, &ldquo;Oh, how pretty he is! What a
      nice little fir!&rdquo; But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year he
      was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tell by the
      shoots how many years old they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are,&rdquo; sighed he. &ldquo;Then I
      should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into
      the wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches: and
      when there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the
      others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morning and
      evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would often
      come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that made him
      so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the Tree was so
      large that the hare was obliged to go round it. &ldquo;To grow and grow, to get
      older and be tall,&rdquo; thought the Tree&mdash;&ldquo;that, after all, is the most
      delightful thing in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest
      trees. This happened every year; and the young Fir Tree, that had now
      grown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent
      great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were
      lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be
      recognised; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged them
      out of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where did they go to? What became of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      In spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them,
      &ldquo;Don't you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them
      anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked musing,
      nodded his head, and said, &ldquo;Yes; I think I know; I met many ships as I was
      flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent masts, and I
      venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir. I may
      congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most majestically!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea
      look in reality? What is it like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would take a long time to explain,&rdquo; said the Stork, and with these
      words off he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejoice in thy growth!&rdquo; said the Sunbeams. &ldquo;Rejoice in thy vigorous
      growth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the Fir
      understood it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down: trees which often
      were not even as large or of the same age as this Fir Tree, who could
      never rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they were
      always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid on
      carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they going to?&rdquo; asked the Fir. &ldquo;They are not taller than I;
      there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they retain
      all their branches? Whither are they taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know! We know!&rdquo; chirped the Sparrows. &ldquo;We have peeped in at the
      windows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest
      splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. We
      peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the warm
      room and ornamented with the most splendid things, with gilded apples,
      with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked the Fir Tree, trembling in every bough. &ldquo;And then? What
      happens then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career,&rdquo; cried the
      Tree, rejoicing. &ldquo;That is still better than to cross the sea! What a
      longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my
      branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh! were
      I but already on the cart! Were I in the warm room with all the splendor
      and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still grander,
      will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me? Something
      better, something still grander must follow&mdash;but what? Oh, how I
      long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejoice in our presence!&rdquo; said the Air and the Sunlight. &ldquo;Rejoice in thy
      own fresh youth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green both
      winter and summer. People that saw him said, &ldquo;What a fine tree!&rdquo; and
      towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe
      struck deep into the very pith; the Tree fell to the earth with a sigh; he
      felt a pang&mdash;it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,
      for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place
      where he had sprung up. He well knew that he should never see his dear old
      comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps not
      even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with
      the other trees, and heard a man say, &ldquo;That one is splendid! We don't want
      the others.&rdquo; Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the Fir
      Tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging on the
      walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese vases
      with lions on the covers. There, too, were large easy-chairs, silken
      sofas, large tables full of picture-books and full of toys, worth hundreds
      and hundreds of crowns&mdash;at least the children said so. And the Fir
      Tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand; but no one
      could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all round it, and
      it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet. Oh! how the Tree quivered! What
      was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it. On
      one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper, and each net
      was filled with sugarplums; and among the other boughs gilded apples and
      walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown there, and little
      blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves. Dolls that looked for
      all the world like men&mdash;the Tree had never beheld such before&mdash;were
      seen among the foliage, and at the very top a large star of gold tinsel
      was fixed. It was really splendid&mdash;beyond description splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening!&rdquo; they all said. &ldquo;How it will shine this evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; thought the Tree. &ldquo;If the evening were but come! If the tapers were
      but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other trees
      from the forest will come to look at me! Perhaps the sparrows will beat
      against the windowpanes! I wonder if I shall take root here, and winter
      and summer stand covered with ornaments!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew very much about the matter&mdash;but he was so impatient that for
      sheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same
      thing as a headache with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candles were now lighted&mdash;what brightness! What splendor! The
      Tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the
      foliage. It blazed up famously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was so
      uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that he was quite
      bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both
      folding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would
      upset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones stood
      quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted that the
      whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing; they danced round the Tree,
      and one present after the other was pulled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they about?&rdquo; thought the Tree. &ldquo;What is to happen now!&rdquo; And the
      lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down they were
      put out one after the other, and then the children had permission to
      plunder the Tree. So they fell upon it with such violence that all its
      branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the ground, it would
      certainly have tumbled down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no one looked
      at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but it
      was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A story! A story!&rdquo; cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards
      the Tree. He seated himself under it and said, &ldquo;Now we are in the shade,
      and the Tree can listen too. But I shall tell only one story. Now which
      will you have; that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about Humpy-Dumpy, who tumbled
      downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married the
      princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivedy-Avedy,&rdquo; cried some; &ldquo;Humpy-Dumpy,&rdquo; cried the others. There was such
      a bawling and screaming&mdash;the Fir Tree alone was silent, and he
      thought to himself, &ldquo;Am I not to bawl with the rest? Am I to do nothing
      whatever?&rdquo; for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the man told about Humpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who notwithstanding
      came to the throne, and at last married the princess. And the children
      clapped their hands, and cried. &ldquo;Oh, go on! Do go on!&rdquo; They wanted to hear
      about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little man only told them about
      Humpy-Dumpy. The Fir Tree stood quite still and absorbed in thought; the
      birds in the wood had never related the like of this. &ldquo;Humpy-Dumpy fell
      downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes, yes! That's the way of
      the world!&rdquo; thought the Fir Tree, and believed it all, because the man who
      told the story was so good-looking. &ldquo;Well, well! who knows, perhaps I may
      fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!&rdquo; And he looked forward
      with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked out again with lights,
      playthings, fruits, and tinsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't tremble to-morrow!&rdquo; thought the Fir Tree. &ldquo;I will enjoy to the
      full all my splendor! To-morrow I shall hear again the story of
      Humpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too.&rdquo; And the whole night the
      Tree stood still and in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then the splendor will begin again,&rdquo; thought the Fir. But they
      dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft: and here, in
      a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. &ldquo;What's the
      meaning of this?&rdquo; thought the Tree. &ldquo;What am I to do here? What shall I
      hear now, I wonder?&rdquo; And he leaned against the wall lost in reverie. Time
      enough had he too for his reflections; for days and nights passed on, and
      nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it was only to put
      some great trunks in a corner, out of the way. There stood the Tree quite
      hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis now winter out-of-doors!&rdquo; thought the Tree. &ldquo;The earth is hard and
      covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been put
      up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! How thoughtful that is!
      How kind man is, after all! If it only were not so dark here, and so
      terribly lonely! Not even a hare! And out in the woods it was so pleasant,
      when the snow was on the ground, and the hare leaped by; yes&mdash;even
      when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then! It is really terribly
      lonely here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squeak! Squeak!&rdquo; said a little Mouse, at the same moment, peeping out of
      his hole. And then another little one came. They snuffed about the Fir
      Tree, and rustled among the branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dreadfully cold,&rdquo; said the Mouse. &ldquo;But for that, it would be
      delightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by no means old,&rdquo; said the Fir Tree. &ldquo;There's many a one
      considerably older than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from,&rdquo; asked the Mice; &ldquo;and what can you do?&rdquo; They were
      so extremely curious. &ldquo;Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the earth.
      Have you never been there? Were you never in the larder, where cheeses lie
      on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where one dances about on tallow
      candles: that place where one enters lean, and comes out again fat and
      portly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no such place,&rdquo; said the Tree. &ldquo;But I know the wood, where the sun
      shines and where the little birds sing.&rdquo; And then he told all about his
      youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they
      listened and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related. &ldquo;Yes,
      in reality those were happy times.&rdquo; And then he told about Christmas-eve,
      when he was decked out with cakes and candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the little Mice, &ldquo;how fortunate you have been, old Fir Tree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by no means old,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I came from the wood this winter; I am
      in my prime, and am only rather short for my age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What delightful stories you know,&rdquo; said the Mice: and the next night they
      came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Tree
      recounted: and the more he related, the more he remembered himself; and it
      appeared as if those times had really been happy times. &ldquo;But they may
      still come&mdash;they may still come! Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet
      he got a princess!&rdquo; and he thought at the moment of a nice little Birch
      Tree growing out in the woods: to the Fir, that would be a real charming
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Humpy-Dumpy?&rdquo; asked the Mice. So then the Fir Tree told the whole
      fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the little
      Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night two more
      Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even; but they said the stories were not
      interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they, too, now began to
      think them not so very amusing either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know only one story?&rdquo; asked the Rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that one,&rdquo; answered the Tree. &ldquo;I heard it on my happiest evening;
      but I did not then know how happy I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very stupid story! Don't you know one about bacon and tallow
      candles? Can't you tell any larder stories?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then good-bye,&rdquo; said the Rats; and they went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: &ldquo;After all,
      it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me, and listened
      to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take good care to
      enjoy myself when I am brought out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of people
      and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the tree was pulled
      out and thrown&mdash;rather hard, it is true&mdash;down on the floor, but
      a man drew him towards the stairs, where the daylight shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now a merry life will begin again,&rdquo; thought the Tree. He felt the fresh
      air, the first sunbeam&mdash;and now he was out in the courtyard. All
      passed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite
      forgot to look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in
      flower; the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the
      lindens were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said, &ldquo;Quirre-vit! My
      husband is come!&rdquo; but it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, I shall really enjoy life,&rdquo; said he exultingly, and spread out
      his branches; but, alas, they were all withered and yellow! It was in a
      corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of tinsel was
      still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced
      at Christmas round the Fir Tree, and were so glad at the sight of him. One
      of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!&rdquo; said he,
      trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in
      the garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark
      corner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the wood, of the
      merry Christmas-eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so much
      pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis over&mdash;'tis past!&rdquo; said the poor Tree. &ldquo;Had I but rejoiced when
      I had reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'tis past!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a
      whole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large
      brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star on
      his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his life.
      However, that was over now&mdash;the Tree gone, the story at an end. All,
      all was over&mdash;every tale must end at last.

      THE SNOW QUEEN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FIRST STORY. Which Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now then, let us begin. When we are at the end of the story, we shall know
      more than we know now: but to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most
      mischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for he
      had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and
      beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but that
      which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified and
      increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes looked
      like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into frights, or
      appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so distorted that they
      were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole, you might be sure
      that it would be magnified and spread over both nose and mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's glorious fun!&rdquo; said the sprite. If a good thought passed through a
      man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed
      heartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites who went to his
      school&mdash;for he kept a sprite school&mdash;told each other that a
      miracle had happened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be
      possible to see how the world really looked. They ran about with the
      mirror; and at last there was not a land or a person who was not
      represented distorted in the mirror. So then they thought they would fly
      up to the sky, and have a joke there. The higher they flew with the
      mirror, the more terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast.
      Higher and higher still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when
      suddenly the mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of
      their hands and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred
      million and more pieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for
      some of these pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they
      flew about in the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there
      they stayed; and then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye
      for that which was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had
      the same power which the whole mirror had possessed. Some persons even got
      a splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart
      became like a lump of ice. Some of the broken pieces were so large that
      they were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's
      friends. Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair
      when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. Then the wicked
      sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his fancy. The
      fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall hear what
      happened next.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND STORY. A Little Boy and a Little Girl
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people, that
      there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and where, on
      this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves with flowers
      in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden somewhat larger
      than a flower-pot. They were not brother and sister; but they cared for
      each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived exactly opposite.
      They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the one house joined
      that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme end of it, there
      was to each house a small window: one needed only to step over the gutter
      to get from one window to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables
      for the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a
      rose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing
      the boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window
      to the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils of
      the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long
      branches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it
      was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were
      very high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so
      they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other,
      and to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play
      delightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows
      were often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the
      stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a
      capital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle
      friendly eye&mdash;it was the little boy and the little girl who were
      looking out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump,
      they could get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to go
      down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and out-of-doors
      there was quite a snow-storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the white bees that are swarming,&rdquo; said Kay's old grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do the white bees choose a queen?&rdquo; asked the little boy; for he knew that
      the honey-bees always have one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the grandmother, &ldquo;she flies where the swarm hangs in the
      thickest clusters. She is the largest of all; and she can never remain
      quietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds. Many a
      winter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in at
      the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they look
      like flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have seen it,&rdquo; said both the children; and so they knew that it
      was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the Snow Queen come in?&rdquo; said the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let her come in!&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;Then I'd put her on the
      stove, and she'd melt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed, he
      climbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little hole.
      A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all, remained
      lying on the edge of a flower-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a young
      lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little flakes
      like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of ice, of
      dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly, like two
      stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She nodded towards
      the window, and beckoned with her hand. The little boy was frightened, and
      jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if, at the same moment, a
      large bird flew past the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day it was a sharp frost&mdash;and then the spring came; the sun
      shone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, the
      windows were opened, and the little children again sat in their pretty
      garden, high up on the leads at the top of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      That summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little girl had
      learned a hymn, in which there was something about roses; and then she
      thought of her own flowers; and she sang the verse to the little boy, who
      then sang it with her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,
     And angels descend there the children to greet.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked up
      at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw angels there.
      What lovely summer-days those were! How delightful to be out in the air,
      near the fresh rose-bushes, that seem as if they would never finish
      blossoming!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kay and Gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds; and
      it was then&mdash;the clock in the church-tower was just striking five&mdash;that
      Kay said, &ldquo;Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now something has
      got into my eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes; now
      there was nothing to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is out now,&rdquo; said he; but it was not. It was just one of those
      pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye; and poor
      Kay had got another piece right in his heart. It will soon become like
      ice. It did not hurt any longer, but there it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying for?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;You look so ugly! There's nothing
      the matter with me. Ah,&rdquo; said he at once, &ldquo;that rose is cankered! And
      look, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are very ugly!
      They are just like the box they are planted in!&rdquo; And then he gave the box
      a good kick with his foot, and pulled both the roses up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried the little girl; and as he perceived her
      fright, he pulled up another rose, got in at the window, and hastened off
      from dear little Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when she brought her picture-book, he asked, &ldquo;What horrid
      beasts have you there?&rdquo; And if his grandmother told them stories, he
      always interrupted her; besides, if he could manage it, he would get
      behind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking; he
      copied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able
      to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. Everything that
      was peculiar and displeasing in them&mdash;that Kay knew how to imitate:
      and at such times all the people said, &ldquo;The boy is certainly very clever!&rdquo;
       But it was the glass he had got in his eye; the glass that was sticking in
      his heart, which made him tease even little Gerda, whose whole soul was
      devoted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His games now were quite different to what they had formerly been, they
      were so very knowing. One winter's day, when the flakes of snow were
      flying about, he spread the skirts of his blue coat, and caught the snow
      as it fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look through this glass, Gerda,&rdquo; said he. And every flake seemed larger,
      and appeared like a magnificent flower, or beautiful star; it was splendid
      to look at!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, how clever!&rdquo; said Kay. &ldquo;That's much more interesting than real
      flowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if
      they did not melt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not long after this, that Kay came one day with large gloves on,
      and his little sledge at his back, and bawled right into Gerda's ears, &ldquo;I
      have permission to go out into the square where the others are playing&rdquo;;
      and off he was in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the market-place, some of the boldest of the boys used to tie
      their sledges to the carts as they passed by, and so they were pulled
      along, and got a good ride. It was so capital! Just as they were in the
      very height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted
      quite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white
      mantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on his head. The sledge drove
      round the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he could,
      and off he drove with it. On they went quicker and quicker into the next
      street; and the person who drove turned round to Kay, and nodded to him in
      a friendly manner, just as if they knew each other. Every time he was
      going to untie his sledge, the person nodded to him, and then Kay sat
      quiet; and so on they went till they came outside the gates of the town.
      Then the snow began to fall so thickly that the little boy could not see
      an arm's length before him, but still on he went: when suddenly he let go
      the string he held in his hand in order to get loose from the sledge, but
      it was of no use; still the little vehicle rushed on with the quickness of
      the wind. He then cried as loud as he could, but no one heard him; the
      snow drifted and the sledge flew on, and sometimes it gave a jerk as
      though they were driving over hedges and ditches. He was quite frightened,
      and he tried to repeat the Lord's Prayer; but all he could do, he was only
      able to remember the multiplication table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow-flakes grew larger and larger, till at last they looked just like
      great white fowls. Suddenly they flew on one side; the large sledge
      stopped, and the person who drove rose up. It was a lady; her cloak and
      cap were of snow. She was tall and of slender figure, and of a dazzling
      whiteness. It was the Snow Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have travelled fast,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but it is freezingly cold. Come under
      my bearskin.&rdquo; And she put him in the sledge beside her, wrapped the fur
      round him, and he felt as though he were sinking in a snow-wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still cold?&rdquo; asked she; and then she kissed his forehead. Ah! it
      was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart, which was already
      almost a frozen lump; it seemed to him as if he were about to die&mdash;but
      a moment more and it was quite congenial to him, and he did not remark the
      cold that was around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!&rdquo; It was the first thing he thought
      of. It was there tied to one of the white chickens, who flew along with it
      on his back behind the large sledge. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once more,
      and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother, and all whom he had left at
      his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will have no more kisses,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;or else I should kiss you
      to death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more lovely
      countenance he could not fancy to himself; and she no longer appeared of
      ice as before, when she sat outside the window, and beckoned to him; in
      his eyes she was perfect, he did not fear her at all, and told her that he
      could calculate in his head and with fractions, even; that he knew the
      number of square miles there were in the different countries, and how many
      inhabitants they contained; and she smiled while he spoke. It then seemed
      to him as if what he knew was not enough, and he looked upwards in the
      large huge empty space above him, and on she flew with him; flew high over
      the black clouds, while the storm moaned and whistled as though it were
      singing some old tune. On they flew over woods and lakes, over seas, and
      many lands; and beneath them the chilling storm rushed fast, the wolves
      howled, the snow crackled; above them flew large screaming crows, but
      higher up appeared the moon, quite large and bright; and it was on it that
      Kay gazed during the long long winter's night; while by day he slept at
      the feet of the Snow Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD STORY. Of the Flower-Garden At the Old Woman's Who Understood
      Witchcraft
    </p>
    <p>
      But what became of little Gerda when Kay did not return? Where could he
      be? Nobody knew; nobody could give any intelligence. All the boys knew
      was, that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid
      one, which drove down the street and out of the town. Nobody knew where he
      was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and bitterly; at
      last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in the river which
      flowed close to the town. Oh! those were very long and dismal winter
      evenings!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last spring came, with its warm sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kay is dead and gone!&rdquo; said little Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don't believe,&rdquo; said the Sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kay is dead and gone!&rdquo; said she to the Swallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don't believe,&rdquo; said they: and at last little Gerda did not think
      so any longer either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put on my red shoes,&rdquo; said she, one morning; &ldquo;Kay has never seen
      them, and then I'll go down to the river and ask there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite early; she kissed her old grandmother, who was still asleep,
      put on her red shoes, and went alone to the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a
      present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner; then
      she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she possessed, and
      threw them both into the river. But they fell close to the bank, and the
      little waves bore them immediately to land; it was as if the stream would
      not take what was dearest to her; for in reality it had not got little
      Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far enough,
      so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went to the
      farthest end, and threw out the shoes. But the boat was not fastened, and
      the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the shore. She
      observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could do so, the
      boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding quickly onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her
      except the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land; but they flew
      along the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, &ldquo;Here we are! Here we are!&rdquo;
       The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda sat quite still without
      shoes, for they were swimming behind the boat, but she could not reach
      them, because the boat went much faster than they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees,
      and slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,&rdquo; said she; and then she
      grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful green
      banks. Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was a little
      cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was thatched, and before it
      two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when anyone went
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of
      course, did not answer. She came close to them, for the stream drifted the
      boat quite near the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the cottage,
      leaning upon a crooked stick. She had a large broad-brimmed hat on,
      painted with the most splendid flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little child!&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;How did you get upon the large
      rapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!&rdquo; And then the old
      woman went into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked stick,
      drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid
      of the strange old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gerda told her all; and the old woman shook her head and said, &ldquo;A-hem!
      a-hem!&rdquo; and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her if she had
      not seen little Kay, the woman answered that he had not passed there, but
      he no doubt would come; and she told her not to be cast down, but taste
      her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than any in a
      picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story. She then took Gerda
      by the hand, led her into the little cottage, and locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows were very high up; the glass was red, blue, and green, and the
      sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors. On the
      table stood the most exquisite cherries, and Gerda ate as many as she
      chose, for she had permission to do so. While she was eating, the old
      woman combed her hair with a golden comb, and her hair curled and shone
      with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face, which was so
      round and so like a rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often longed for such a dear little girl,&rdquo; said the old woman.
      &ldquo;Now you shall see how well we agree together&rdquo;; and while she combed
      little Gerda's hair, the child forgot her foster-brother Kay more and
      more, for the old woman understood magic; but she was no evil being, she
      only practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement, and now
      she wanted very much to keep little Gerda. She therefore went out in the
      garden, stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes, which,
      beautifully as they were blowing, all sank into the earth and no one could
      tell where they had stood. The old woman feared that if Gerda should see
      the roses, she would then think of her own, would remember little Kay, and
      run away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now led Gerda into the flower-garden. Oh, what odour and what
      loveliness was there! Every flower that one could think of, and of every
      season, stood there in fullest bloom; no picture-book could be gayer or
      more beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till the sun set behind
      the tall cherry-tree; she then had a pretty bed, with a red silken
      coverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and had as pleasant
      dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine,
      and thus passed away a day. Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as they
      were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she did not
      know which. One day while she was looking at the hat of the old woman
      painted with flowers, the most beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a
      rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when she made
      the others vanish in the earth. But so it is when one's thoughts are not
      collected. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Gerda. &ldquo;Are there no roses here?&rdquo; and she ran
      about amongst the flowerbeds, and looked, and looked, but there was not
      one to be found. She then sat down and wept; but her hot tears fell just
      where a rose-bush had sunk; and when her warm tears watered the ground,
      the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as when it had been
      swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her own dear roses at
      home, and with them of little Kay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how long I have stayed!&rdquo; said the little girl. &ldquo;I intended to look
      for Kay! Don't you know where he is?&rdquo; she asked of the roses. &ldquo;Do you
      think he is dead and gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead he certainly is not,&rdquo; said the Roses. &ldquo;We have been in the earth
      where all the dead are, but Kay was not there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks!&rdquo; said little Gerda; and she went to the other flowers,
      looked into their cups, and asked, &ldquo;Don't you know where little Kay is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But every flower stood in the sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy tale or
      its own story: and they all told her very many things, but not one knew
      anything of Kay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what did the Tiger-Lily say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two tones. Always
      bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the call of the
      priests! The Hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the funeral pile;
      the flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the Hindoo woman
      thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle; on him whose eyes burn
      hotter than the flames&mdash;on him, the fire of whose eyes pierces her
      heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to ashes. Can the
      heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand that at all,&rdquo; said little Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my story,&rdquo; said the Lily.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did the Convolvulus say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal castle.
      Thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls, and around the altar,
      where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and looks
      out upon the rose. No fresher rose hangs on the branches than she; no
      appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! How her silken robe
      is rustling!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is he not yet come?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Kay that you mean?&rdquo; asked little Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking about my story&mdash;about my dream,&rdquo; answered the
      Convolvulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did the Snowdrops say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between the trees a long board is hanging&mdash;it is a swing. Two little
      girls are sitting in it, and swing themselves backwards and forwards;
      their frocks are as white as snow, and long green silk ribands flutter
      from their bonnets. Their brother, who is older than they are, stands up
      in the swing; he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast, for
      in one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay-pipe. He is
      blowing soap-bubbles. The swing moves, and the bubbles float in charming
      changing colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe, and
      rocks in the breeze. The swing moves. The little black dog, as light as a
      soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing. It
      moves, the dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They tease him; the bubble
      bursts! A swing, a bursting bubble&mdash;such is my song!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a
      manner, and do not mention Kay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What do the Hyacinths say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very
      beautiful. The robe of the one was red, that of the second blue, and that
      of the third white. They danced hand in hand beside the calm lake in the
      clear moonshine. They were not elfin maidens, but mortal children. A sweet
      fragrance was smelt, and the maidens vanished in the wood; the fragrance
      grew stronger&mdash;three coffins, and in them three lovely maidens,
      glided out of the forest and across the lake: the shining glow-worms flew
      around like little floating lights. Do the dancing maidens sleep, or are
      they dead? The odour of the flowers says they are corpses; the evening
      bell tolls for the dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me quite sad,&rdquo; said little Gerda. &ldquo;I cannot help thinking of the
      dead maidens. Oh! is little Kay really dead? The Roses have been in the
      earth, and they say no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ding, dong!&rdquo; sounded the Hyacinth bells. &ldquo;We do not toll for little Kay;
      we do not know him. That is our way of singing, the only one we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the
      shining green leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a little bright sun!&rdquo; said Gerda. &ldquo;Tell me if you know where I
      can find my playfellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What song
      could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of spring.
      The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house, and close by
      the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in the warm
      sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her grand-daughter,
      the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit. She knows her
      grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that blessed kiss. There,
      that is my little story,&rdquo; said the Ranunculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor old grandmother!&rdquo; sighed Gerda. &ldquo;Yes, she is longing for me, no
      doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I will soon
      come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use asking the
      flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me nothing.&rdquo;
       And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but the
      Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to jump over
      it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and asked, &ldquo;You
      perhaps know something?&rdquo; and she bent down to the Narcissus. And what did
      it say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see myself&mdash;I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the
      little garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands now
      on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives only
      in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of stuff
      which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a fine
      thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the
      teapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored
      kerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see myself&mdash;I
      can see myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing to me,&rdquo; said little Gerda. &ldquo;That does not concern me.&rdquo; And
      then off she ran to the further end of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened,
      and the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide
      world. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she
      could run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked
      about her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the autumn,
      but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where there was
      always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, how long I have staid!&rdquo; said Gerda. &ldquo;Autumn is come. I must not
      rest any longer.&rdquo; And she got up to go further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how tender and wearied her little feet were! All around it looked so
      cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and the fog
      dripped from them like water; one leaf fell after the other: the sloes
      only stood full of fruit, which set one's teeth on edge. Oh, how dark and
      comfortless it was in the dreary world!
    </p>
    <p>
      FOURTH STORY. The Prince and Princess
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her, a
      large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking at
      Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, &ldquo;Caw! Caw!&rdquo; Good day! Good
      day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the little
      girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word &ldquo;alone&rdquo; Gerda
      understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed by it; so she told
      the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Raven nodded very gravely, and said, &ldquo;It may be&mdash;it may be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, do you really think so?&rdquo; cried the little girl; and she nearly
      squeezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, gently,&rdquo; said the Raven. &ldquo;I think I know; I think that it may be
      little Kay. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he live with a Princess?&rdquo; asked Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;listen,&rdquo; said the Raven; &ldquo;but it will be difficult for me to
      speak your language. If you understand the Raven language I can tell you
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not learnt it,&rdquo; said Gerda; &ldquo;but my grandmother understands
      it, and she can speak gibberish too. I wish I had learnt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said the Raven; &ldquo;I will tell you as well as I can; however,
      it will be bad enough.&rdquo; And then he told all he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is
      extraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole
      world, and has forgotten them again&mdash;so clever is she. She was
      lately, it is said, sitting on her throne&mdash;which is not very amusing
      after all&mdash;when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh,
      why should I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said
      she, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a husband
      who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to&mdash;not one who
      looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so tiresome. She
      then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and when they heard
      her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are very glad to hear
      it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may believe every word
      I say,&rdquo; said the Raven; &ldquo;for I have a tame sweetheart that hops about in
      the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the
      initials of the Princess; and therein you might read that every
      good-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to
      the Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at
      home there, that one the Princess would choose for her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes,&rdquo; said the Raven, &ldquo;you may believe it; it is as true as I am
      sitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but no
      one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all talk
      well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as they came
      inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed in silver, and
      the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large illuminated saloons,
      then they were abashed; and when they stood before the throne on which the
      Princess was sitting, all they could do was to repeat the last word they
      had uttered, and to hear it again did not interest her very much. It was
      just as if the people within were under a charm, and had fallen into a
      trance till they came out again into the street; for then&mdash;oh, then&mdash;they
      could chatter enough. There was a whole row of them standing from the
      town-gates to the palace. I was there myself to look,&rdquo; said the Raven.
      &ldquo;They grew hungry and thirsty; but from the palace they got nothing
      whatever, not even a glass of water. Some of the cleverest, it is true,
      had taken bread and butter with them: but none shared it with his
      neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look hungry, and then the Princess
      won't have him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Kay&mdash;little Kay,&rdquo; said Gerda, &ldquo;when did he come? Was he among
      the number?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, patience; we are just come to him. It was on the third day when
      a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right boldly
      up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful long hair,
      but his clothes were very shabby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Kay,&rdquo; cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. &ldquo;Oh, now I've found
      him!&rdquo; and she clapped her hands for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a little knapsack at his back,&rdquo; said the Raven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that was certainly his sledge,&rdquo; said Gerda; &ldquo;for when he went away he
      took his sledge with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the Raven; &ldquo;I did not examine him so minutely; but I
      know from my tame sweetheart, that when he came into the court-yard of the
      palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, the lackeys on the staircase, he
      was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said to them, 'It must be very
      tiresome to stand on the stairs; for my part, I shall go in.' The saloons
      were gleaming with lustres&mdash;privy councillors and excellencies were
      walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was enough to make any
      one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so loudly, but still he
      was not at all afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Kay for certain,&rdquo; said Gerda. &ldquo;I know he had on new boots; I have
      heard them creaking in grandmama's room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they creaked,&rdquo; said the Raven. &ldquo;And on he went boldly up to the
      Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel. All the
      ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants' attendants, and
      all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen's gentlemen, stood
      round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the prouder they looked. It
      was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's gentleman, so very
      haughtily did he stand in the doorway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been terrible,&rdquo; said little Gerda. &ldquo;And did Kay get the
      Princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I not a Raven, I should have taken the Princess myself, although I
      am promised. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk Raven
      language; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely
      behaved; he had not come to woo the Princess, but only to hear her wisdom.
      She pleased him, and he pleased her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay,&rdquo; said Gerda. &ldquo;He was so clever; he
      could reckon fractions in his head. Oh, won't you take me to the palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very easily said,&rdquo; answered the Raven. &ldquo;But how are we to manage
      it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise us; for so
      much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will never get
      permission to enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes I shall,&rdquo; said Gerda; &ldquo;when Kay hears that I am here, he will
      come out directly to fetch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for me here on these steps,&rdquo; said the Raven. He moved his head
      backwards and forwards and flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was closing in when the Raven returned. &ldquo;Caw&mdash;caw!&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took
      it out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry, no
      doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are
      barefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not allow
      it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a little
      back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she can get
      the key of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went into the garden in the large avenue, where one leaf was
      falling after the other; and when the lights in the palace had all
      gradually disappeared, the Raven led little Gerda to the back door, which
      stood half open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how Gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing! It was just as if she
      had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only wanted to know if
      little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She called to mind his
      intelligent eyes, and his long hair, so vividly, she could quite see him
      as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home. &ldquo;He
      will, no doubt, be glad to see you&mdash;to hear what a long way you have
      come for his sake; to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not
      come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, what a fright and a joy it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there; and on the
      floor stood the tame Raven, turning her head on every side and looking at
      Gerda, who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said
      the tame Raven. &ldquo;Your tale is very affecting. If you will take the lamp, I
      will go before. We will go straight on, for we shall meet no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is somebody just behind us,&rdquo; said Gerda; and something
      rushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall; horses with flowing
      manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are only dreams,&rdquo; said the Raven. &ldquo;They come to fetch the thoughts
      of the high personages to the chase; 'tis well, for now you can observe
      them in bed all the better. But let me find, when you enjoy honor and
      distinction, that you possess a grateful heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! That's not worth talking about,&rdquo; said the Raven of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now entered the first saloon, which was of rose-colored satin, with
      artificial flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were rushing past, but
      they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the high personages.
      One hall was more magnificent than the other; one might indeed well be
      abashed; and at last they came into the bedchamber. The ceiling of the
      room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass, of costly glass;
      and in the middle, from a thick golden stem, hung two beds, each of which
      resembled a lily. One was white, and in this lay the Princess; the other
      was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for little Kay. She bent
      back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck. Oh! that was Kay! She
      called him quite loud by name, held the lamp towards him&mdash;the dreams
      rushed back again into the chamber&mdash;he awoke, turned his head, and&mdash;it
      was not little Kay!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young and
      handsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped, too, and
      asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda cried, and told her her whole
      history, and all that the Ravens had done for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo; said the Prince and the Princess. They praised the
      Ravens very much, and told them they were not at all angry with them, but
      they were not to do so again. However, they should have a reward. &ldquo;Will
      you fly about here at liberty,&rdquo; asked the Princess; &ldquo;or would you like to
      have a fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the broken bits from
      the kitchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And both the Ravens nodded, and begged for a fixed appointment; for they
      thought of their old age, and said, &ldquo;It is a good thing to have a
      provision for our old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed, and more than this
      he could not do. She folded her little hands and thought, &ldquo;How good men
      and animals are!&rdquo; and she then fell asleep and slept soundly. All the
      dreams flew in again, and they now looked like the angels; they drew a
      little sledge, in which little Kay sat and nodded his head; but the whole
      was only a dream, and therefore it all vanished as soon as she awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. They
      offered to let her stay at the palace, and lead a happy life; but she
      begged to have a little carriage with a horse in front, and for a small
      pair of shoes; then, she said, she would again go forth in the wide world
      and look for Kay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shoes and a muff were given her; she was, too, dressed very nicely; and
      when she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped before the door. It
      was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone like a
      star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for outriders
      were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the Princess
      assisted her into the carriage themselves, and wished her all success. The
      Raven of the woods, who was now married, accompanied her for the first
      three miles. He sat beside Gerda, for he could not bear riding backwards;
      the other Raven stood in the doorway, and flapped her wings; she could not
      accompany Gerda, because she suffered from headache since she had had a
      fixed appointment and ate so much. The carriage was lined inside with
      sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and gingerbread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell! Farewell!&rdquo; cried Prince and Princess; and Gerda wept, and the
      Raven wept. Thus passed the first miles; and then the Raven bade her
      farewell, and this was the most painful separation of all. He flew into a
      tree, and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage, that
      shone from afar like a sunbeam.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIFTH STORY. The Little Robber Maiden
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove through the dark wood; but the carriage shone like a torch, and
      it dazzled the eyes of the robbers, so that they could not bear to look at
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis gold! 'Tis gold!&rdquo; they cried; and they rushed forward, seized the
      horses, knocked down the little postilion, the coachman, and the servants,
      and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on nut-kernels,&rdquo;
       said the old female robber, who had a long, scrubby beard, and bushy
      eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. &ldquo;She is as good as a fatted lamb!
      How nice she will be!&rdquo; And then she drew out a knife, the blade of which
      shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the woman at the same moment. She had been bitten in the ear
      by her own little daughter, who hung at her back; and who was so wild and
      unmanageable, that it was quite amusing to see her. &ldquo;You naughty child!&rdquo;
       said the mother: and now she had not time to kill Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall play with me,&rdquo; said the little robber child. &ldquo;She shall give me
      her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!&rdquo; And then she
      gave her mother another bite, so that she jumped, and ran round with the
      pain; and the Robbers laughed, and said, &ldquo;Look, how she is dancing with
      the little one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go into the carriage,&rdquo; said the little robber maiden; and she
      would have her will, for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. She and
      Gerda got in; and then away they drove over the stumps of felled trees,
      deeper and deeper into the woods. The little robber maiden was as tall as
      Gerda, but stronger, broader-shouldered, and of dark complexion; her eyes
      were quite black; they looked almost melancholy. She embraced little
      Gerda, and said, &ldquo;They shall not kill you as long as I am not displeased
      with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said little Gerda; who then related all that had happened to her,
      and how much she cared about little Kay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air, nodded her head
      slightly, and said, &ldquo;They shall not kill you, even if I am angry with you:
      then I will do it myself&rdquo;; and she dried Gerda's eyes, and put both her
      hands in the handsome muff, which was so soft and warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the carriage stopped. They were in the midst of the court-yard
      of a robber's castle. It was full of cracks from top to bottom; and out of
      the openings magpies and rooks were flying; and the great bull-dogs, each
      of which looked as if he could swallow a man, jumped up, but they did not
      bark, for that was forbidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the large, old, smoking hall burnt a great fire on the
      stone floor. The smoke disappeared under the stones, and had to seek its
      own egress. In an immense caldron soup was boiling; and rabbits and hares
      were being roasted on a spit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals,&rdquo; said the little
      robber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into a
      corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and
      perches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet they
      moved a little when the robber maiden came. &ldquo;They are all mine,&rdquo; said she,
      at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs and shaking
      it so that its wings fluttered. &ldquo;Kiss it,&rdquo; cried the little girl, and
      flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. &ldquo;Up there is the rabble of the wood,&rdquo;
       continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened before a hole
      high up in the wall; &ldquo;that's the rabble; they would all fly away
      immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my dear old
      Bac&rdquo;; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a bright
      copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. &ldquo;We are obliged
      to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every evening I
      tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at it!&rdquo; and the
      little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the wall, and let it
      glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked; the girl laughed,
      and pulled Gerda into bed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?&rdquo; asked Gerda; looking
      at it rather fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always sleep with the knife,&rdquo; said the little robber maiden. &ldquo;There is
      no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about little
      Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone.&rdquo; And Gerda
      related all, from the very beginning: the Wood-pigeons cooed above in
      their cage, and the others slept. The little robber maiden wound her arm
      round Gerda's neck, held the knife in the other hand, and snored so loud
      that everybody could hear her; but Gerda could not close her eyes, for she
      did not know whether she was to live or die. The robbers sat round the
      fire, sang and drank; and the old female robber jumped about so, that it
      was quite dreadful for Gerda to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Wood-pigeons said, &ldquo;Coo! Coo! We have seen little Kay! A white
      hen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow Queen,
      who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest. She blew
      upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you say up there?&rdquo; cried little Gerda. &ldquo;Where did the Snow
      Queen go to? Do you know anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice there.
      Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!&rdquo; said the
      Reindeer. &ldquo;One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow
      Queen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards
      the North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!&rdquo; sighed Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you choose to be quiet?&rdquo; said the robber maiden. &ldquo;If you don't, I
      shall make you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had said; and the
      little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and said,
      &ldquo;That's no matter&mdash;that's no matter. Do you know where Lapland lies!&rdquo;
       she asked of the Reindeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who should know better than I?&rdquo; said the animal; and his eyes rolled in
      his head. &ldquo;I was born and bred there&mdash;there I leapt about on the
      fields of snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the robber maiden to Gerda. &ldquo;You see that the men are gone;
      but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards morning she
      takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps a little: then
      I will do something for you.&rdquo; She now jumped out of bed, flew to her
      mother; with her arms round her neck, and pulling her by the beard, said,
      &ldquo;Good morrow, my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother.&rdquo; And her mother took
      hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red and blue; but this was
      all done out of pure love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the mother had taken a sup at her flask, and was having a nap, the
      little robber maiden went to the Reindeer, and said, &ldquo;I should very much
      like to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then you
      are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out, so that
      you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your legs; and
      take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen, where her
      playfellow is. You have heard, I suppose, all she said; for she spoke loud
      enough, and you were listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reindeer gave a bound for joy. The robber maiden lifted up little
      Gerda, and took the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer's back;
      she even gave her a small cushion to sit on. &ldquo;Here are your worsted
      leggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for it
      is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair of
      lined gloves of my mother's; they just reach up to your elbow. On with
      them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gerda wept for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear to see you fretting,&rdquo; said the little robber maiden. &ldquo;This
      is just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and a
      ham for you, so that you won't starve.&rdquo; The bread and the meat were
      fastened to the Reindeer's back; the little maiden opened the door, called
      in all the dogs, and then with her knife cut the rope that fastened the
      animal, and said to him, &ldquo;Now, off with you; but take good care of the
      little girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards the
      robber maiden, and said, &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; and the Reindeer flew on over bush
      and bramble through the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast as he
      could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ddsa! Ddsa!&rdquo; was heard in the sky. It was just as if somebody was
      sneezing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are my old northern-lights,&rdquo; said the Reindeer, &ldquo;look how they
      gleam!&rdquo; And on he now sped still quicker&mdash;day and night on he went:
      the loaves were consumed, and the ham too; and now they were in Lapland.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIXTH STORY. The Lapland Woman and the Finland Woman
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly they stopped before a little house, which looked very miserable.
      The roof reached to the ground; and the door was so low, that the family
      were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in or out. Nobody
      was at home except an old Lapland woman, who was dressing fish by the
      light of an oil lamp. And the Reindeer told her the whole of Gerda's
      history, but first of all his own; for that seemed to him of much greater
      importance. Gerda was so chilled that she could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said the Lapland woman, &ldquo;you have far to run still. You have
      more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there the Snow
      Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every evening. I will
      give you a few words from me, which I will write on a dried haberdine, for
      paper I have none; this you can take with you to the Finland woman, and
      she will be able to give you more information than I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland woman
      wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care of them,
      put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the animal.
      &ldquo;Ddsa! Ddsa!&rdquo; was again heard in the air; the most charming blue lights
      burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to Finland. They
      knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a door, she had
      none.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about
      almost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened
      little Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for
      otherwise the heat would have been too great&mdash;and after laying a
      piece of ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the
      fish-skin. She read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put
      the fish into the cupboard&mdash;for it might very well be eaten, and she
      never threw anything away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that of
      little Gerda; and the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so clever,&rdquo; said the Reindeer; &ldquo;you can, I know, twist all the
      winds of the world together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one knot,
      then he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if he
      undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are
      upturned. Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess
      the strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The strength of twelve men!&rdquo; said the Finland woman. &ldquo;Much good that
      would be!&rdquo; Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a large skin rolled
      up. When she had unrolled it, strange characters were to be seen written
      thereon; and the Finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration
      trickled down her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so
      imploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she winked, and
      drew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together,
      while the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen's, and finds everything there
      quite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world; but
      the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in his
      heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back to
      mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with
      power over the whole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don't you see how
      great it is? Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve her;
      how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear of her
      power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is a sweet and
      innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by herself, and rid
      little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles hence the garden of
      the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the little girl. Set her down
      by the large bush with red berries, standing in the snow; don't stay
      talking, but hasten back as fast as possible.&rdquo; And now the Finland woman
      placed little Gerda on the Reindeer's back, and off he ran with all
      imaginable speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!&rdquo; cried little
      Gerda. She remarked she was without them from the cutting frost; but the
      Reindeer dared not stand still; on he ran till he came to the great bush
      with the red berries, and there he set Gerda down, kissed her mouth, while
      large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes, and then back he went as
      fast as possible. There stood poor Gerda now, without shoes or gloves, in
      the very middle of dreadful icy Finland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran on as fast as she could. There then came a whole regiment of
      snow-flakes, but they did not fall from above, and they were quite bright
      and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran along the ground, and
      the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda well remembered how large
      and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she once saw them through a
      magnifying-glass; but now they were large and terrific in another manner&mdash;they
      were all alive. They were the outposts of the Snow Queen. They had the
      most wondrous shapes; some looked like large ugly porcupines; others like
      snakes knotted together, with their heads sticking out; and others, again,
      like small fat bears, with the hair standing on end: all were of dazzling
      whiteness&mdash;all were living snow-flakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that she
      could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It grew
      thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew more
      and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads, and
      lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and when
      Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole
      legion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that
      they flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and
      in security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the
      cold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we shall see how Kay fared. He never thought of Gerda, and least
      of all that she was standing before the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      SEVENTH STORY. What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow Queen, and what
      Happened Afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors of
      cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according as
      the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in extent;
      all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all were so
      large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never reigned
      there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm for music,
      while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off their steps.
      Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast, cold, and empty
      were the halls of the Snow Queen. The northern-lights shone with such
      precision that one could tell exactly when they were at their highest or
      lowest degree of brightness. In the middle of the empty, endless hall of
      snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a thousand pieces, but each
      piece was so like the other, that it seemed the work of a cunning
      artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow Queen when she was at
      home; and then she said she was sitting in the Mirror of Understanding,
      and that this was the only one and the best thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not
      observe it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body, and
      his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some pointed flat
      pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he wanted
      to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces of wood to
      make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle. Kay made all
      sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was an ice-puzzle for the
      understanding. In his eyes the figures were extraordinarily beautiful, and
      of the utmost importance; for the bit of glass which was in his eye caused
      this. He found whole figures which represented a written word; but he
      never could manage to represent just the word he wanted&mdash;that word
      was &ldquo;eternity&rdquo;; and the Snow Queen had said, &ldquo;If you can discover that
      figure, you shall be your own master, and I will make you a present of the
      whole world and a pair of new skates.&rdquo; But he could not find it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going now to warm lands,&rdquo; said the Snow Queen. &ldquo;I must have a look
      down into the black caldrons.&rdquo; It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna that
      she meant. &ldquo;I will just give them a coating of white, for that is as it
      ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes.&rdquo; And then
      away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of ice that were
      miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought and thought till
      his skull was almost cracked. There he sat quite benumbed and motionless;
      one would have imagined he was frozen to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly little Gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace.
      The gate was formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated her evening
      prayer, and the winds were laid as though they slept; and the little
      maiden entered the vast, empty, cold halls. There she beheld Kay: she
      recognised him, flew to embrace him, and cried out, her arms firmly
      holding him the while, &ldquo;Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at
      last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he sat quite still, benumbed and cold. Then little Gerda shed burning
      tears; and they fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his heart, they
      thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed the splinters of the looking-glass;
      he looked at her, and she sang the hymn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there the
      children to greet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so much that the splinter rolled
      out of his eye, and he recognised her, and shouted, &ldquo;Gerda, sweet little
      Gerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?&rdquo; He looked
      round him. &ldquo;How cold it is here!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How empty and cold!&rdquo; And he
      held fast by Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy. It was so beautiful,
      that even the blocks of ice danced about for joy; and when they were tired
      and laid themselves down, they formed exactly the letters which the Snow
      Queen had told him to find out; so now he was his own master, and he would
      have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite blooming; she kissed his
      eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and he
      was again well and merry. The Snow Queen might come back as soon as she
      liked; there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took each other by the hand, and wandered forth out of the large
      hall; they talked of their old grandmother, and of the roses upon the
      roof; and wherever they went, the winds ceased raging, and the sun burst
      forth. And when they reached the bush with the red berries, they found the
      Reindeer waiting for them. He had brought another, a young one, with him,
      whose udder was filled with milk, which he gave to the little ones, and
      kissed their lips. They then carried Kay and Gerda&mdash;first to the
      Finland woman, where they warmed themselves in the warm room, and learned
      what they were to do on their journey home; and they went to the Lapland
      woman, who made some new clothes for them and repaired their sledges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them, and accompanied
      them to the boundary of the country. Here the first vegetation peeped
      forth; here Kay and Gerda took leave of the Lapland woman. &ldquo;Farewell!
      Farewell!&rdquo; they all said. And the first green buds appeared, the first
      little birds began to chirrup; and out of the wood came, riding on a
      magnificent horse, which Gerda knew (it was one of the leaders in the
      golden carriage), a young damsel with a bright-red cap on her head, and
      armed with pistols. It was the little robber maiden, who, tired of being
      at home, had determined to make a journey to the north; and afterwards in
      another direction, if that did not please her. She recognised Gerda
      immediately, and Gerda knew her too. It was a joyful meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fine fellow for tramping about,&rdquo; said she to little Kay; &ldquo;I
      should like to know, faith, if you deserve that one should run from one
      end of the world to the other for your sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gerda patted her cheeks, and inquired for the Prince and Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are gone abroad,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Raven?&rdquo; asked little Gerda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! The Raven is dead,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;His tame sweetheart is a widow,
      and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments most
      piteously, but it's all mere talk and stuff! Now tell me what you've been
      doing and how you managed to catch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gerda and Kay both told their story.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &ldquo;Schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre,&rdquo; said the robber maiden; and she
      took the hands of each, and promised that if she should some day pass
      through the town where they lived, she would come and visit them; and then
      away she rode. Kay and Gerda took each other's hand: it was lovely spring
      weather, with abundance of flowers and of verdure. The church-bells rang,
      and the children recognised the high towers, and the large town; it was
      that in which they dwelt. They entered and hastened up to their
      grandmother's room, where everything was standing as formerly. The clock
      said &ldquo;tick! tack!&rdquo; and the finger moved round; but as they entered, they
      remarked that they were now grown up. The roses on the leads hung blooming
      in at the open window; there stood the little children's chairs, and Kay
      and Gerda sat down on them, holding each other by the hand; they both had
      forgotten the cold empty splendor of the Snow Queen, as though it had been
      a dream. The grandmother sat in the bright sunshine, and read aloud from
      the Bible: &ldquo;Unless ye become as little children, ye cannot enter the
      kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Kay and Gerda looked in each other's eyes, and all at once they
      understood the old hymn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there the
      children to greet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There sat the two grown-up persons; grown-up, and yet children; children
      at least in heart; and it was summer-time; summer, glorious summer!

    <h2>
      THE LEAP-FROG
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could jump
      highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else besides who
      chose to come to see the festival. Three famous jumpers were they, as
      everyone would say, when they all met together in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,&rdquo; exclaimed the King;
      &ldquo;for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Flea was the first to step forward. He had exquisite manners, and
      bowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and was,
      moreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that makes a great
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the Grasshopper. He was considerably heavier, but he was
      well-mannered, and wore a green uniform, which he had by right of birth;
      he said, moreover, that he belonged to a very ancient Egyptian family, and
      that in the house where he then was, he was thought much of. The fact was,
      he had been just brought out of the fields, and put in a pasteboard house,
      three stories high, all made of court-cards, with the colored side
      inwards; and doors and windows cut out of the body of the Queen of Hearts.
      &ldquo;I sing so well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that sixteen native grasshoppers who have
      chirped from infancy, and yet got no house built of cards to live in, grew
      thinner than they were before for sheer vexation when they heard me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of
      themselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion, that he
      therefore thought the more; and when the housedog snuffed at him with his
      nose, he confessed the Leap-frog was of good family. The old councillor,
      who had had three orders given him to make him hold his tongue, asserted
      that the Leap-frog was a prophet; for that one could see on his back, if
      there would be a severe or mild winter, and that was what one could not
      see even on the back of the man who writes the almanac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing, it is true,&rdquo; exclaimed the King; &ldquo;but I have my own
      opinion, notwithstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the trial was to take place. The Flea jumped so high that nobody could
      see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not jumped at all; and
      that was dishonorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's
      face, who said that was ill-mannered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought; it was believed
      at last he would not jump at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope he is not unwell,&rdquo; said the house-dog; when, pop! he made a
      jump all on one side into the lap of the Princess, who was sitting on a
      little golden stool close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon the King said, &ldquo;There is nothing above my daughter; therefore to
      bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made; but for this, one
      must possess understanding, and the Leap-frog has shown that he has
      understanding. He is brave and intellectual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he won the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all the same to me,&rdquo; said the Flea. &ldquo;She may have the old Leap-frog,
      for all I care. I jumped the highest; but in this world merit seldom meets
      its reward. A fine exterior is what people look at now-a-days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank, and reflected on worldly
      things; and he said too, &ldquo;Yes, a fine exterior is everything&mdash;a fine
      exterior is what people care about.&rdquo; And then he began chirping his
      peculiar melancholy song, from which we have taken this history; and which
      may, very possibly, be all untrue, although it does stand here printed in
      black and white.

    <h2>
      THE ELDERBUSH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold. He had gone
      out and got his feet wet; though nobody could imagine how it had happened,
      for it was quite dry weather. So his mother undressed him, put him to bed,
      and had the tea-pot brought in, to make him a good cup of Elderflower tea.
      Just at that moment the merry old man came in who lived up a-top of the
      house all alone; for he had neither wife nor children&mdash;but he liked
      children very much, and knew so many fairy tales, that it was quite
      delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now drink your tea,&rdquo; said the boy's mother; &ldquo;then, perhaps, you may hear
      a fairy tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had but something new to tell,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;But how did the
      child get his feet wet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very thing that nobody can make out,&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to hear a fairy tale?&rdquo; asked the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you can tell me exactly&mdash;for I must know that first&mdash;how
      deep the gutter is in the little street opposite, that you pass through in
      going to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just up to the middle of my boot,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;but then I must go
      into the deep hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! That's where the wet feet came from,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I ought
      now to tell you a story; but I don't know any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make one in a moment,&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;My mother says that
      all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can find a
      story in everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but such tales and stories are good for nothing. The right sort come
      of themselves; they tap at my forehead and say, 'Here we are.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't there be a tap soon?&rdquo; asked the little boy. And his mother laughed,
      put some Elder-flowers in the tea-pot, and poured boiling water upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me something! Pray do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if a fairy tale would come of its own accord; but they are proud and
      haughty, and come only when they choose. Stop!&rdquo; said he, all on a sudden.
      &ldquo;I have it! Pay attention! There is one in the tea-pot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the little boy looked at the tea-pot. The cover rose more and more;
      and the Elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white, and shot up long
      branches. Out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides,
      and grew larger and larger; it was a splendid Elderbush, a whole tree; and
      it reached into the very bed, and pushed the curtains aside. How it
      bloomed! And what an odour! In the middle of the bush sat a
      friendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress. It was quite green,
      like the leaves of the elder, and was trimmed with large white
      Elder-flowers; so that at first one could not tell whether it was a stuff,
      or a natural green and real flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that woman's name?&rdquo; asked the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Greeks and Romans,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;called her a Dryad; but that
      we do not understand. The people who live in the New Booths [*] have a
      much better name for her; they call her 'old Granny'&mdash;and she it is
      to whom you are to pay attention. Now listen, and look at the beautiful
      Elderbush.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A row of buildings for seamen in Copenhagen.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just such another large blooming Elder Tree stands near the New Booths.
      It grew there in the corner of a little miserable court-yard; and under it
      sat, of an afternoon, in the most splendid sunshine, two old people; an
      old, old seaman, and his old, old wife. They had great-grand-children, and
      were soon to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage; but
      they could not exactly recollect the date: and old Granny sat in the tree,
      and looked as pleased as now. 'I know the date,' said she; but those below
      did not hear her, for they were talking about old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, can't you remember when we were very little,' said the old seaman,
      'and ran and played about? It was the very same court-yard where we now
      are, and we stuck slips in the ground, and made a garden.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I remember it well,' said the old woman; 'I remember it quite well. We
      watered the slips, and one of them was an Elderbush. It took root, put
      forth green shoots, and grew up to be the large tree under which we old
      folks are now sitting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To be sure,' said he. 'And there in the corner stood a waterpail, where
      I used to swim my boats.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'True; but first we went to school to learn somewhat,' said she; 'and
      then we were confirmed. We both cried; but in the afternoon we went up the
      Round Tower, and looked down on Copenhagen, and far, far away over the
      water; then we went to Friedericksberg, where the King and the Queen were
      sailing about in their splendid barges.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But I had a different sort of sailing to that, later; and that, too, for
      many a year; a long way off, on great voyages.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, many a time have I wept for your sake,' said she. 'I thought you
      were dead and gone, and lying down in the deep waters. Many a night have I
      got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had, sure
      enough; but you never came. I remember so well one day, when the rain was
      pouring down in torrents, the scavengers were before the house where I was
      in service, and I had come up with the dust, and remained standing at the
      door&mdash;it was dreadful weather&mdash;when just as I was there, the
      postman came and gave me a letter. It was from you! What a tour that
      letter had made! I opened it instantly and read: I laughed and wept. I was
      so happy. In it I read that you were in warm lands where the coffee-tree
      grows. What a blessed land that must be! You related so much, and I saw it
      all the while the rain was pouring down, and I standing there with the
      dust-box. At the same moment came someone who embraced me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes; but you gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But I did not know it was you. You arrived as soon as your letter, and
      you were so handsome&mdash;that you still are&mdash;and had a long yellow
      silk handkerchief round your neck, and a bran new hat on; oh, you were so
      dashing! Good heavens! What weather it was, and what a state the street
      was in!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And then we married,' said he. 'Don't you remember? And then we had our
      first little boy, and then Mary, and Nicholas, and Peter, and Christian.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, and how they all grew up to be honest people, and were beloved by
      everybody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And their children also have children,' said the old sailor; 'yes, those
      are our grand-children, full of strength and vigor. It was, methinks about
      this season that we had our wedding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, this very day is the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage,' said
      old Granny, sticking her head between the two old people; who thought it
      was their neighbor who nodded to them. They looked at each other and held
      one another by the hand. Soon after came their children, and their
      grand-children; for they knew well enough that it was the day of the
      fiftieth anniversary, and had come with their gratulations that very
      morning; but the old people had forgotten it, although they were able to
      remember all that had happened many years ago. And the Elderbush sent
      forth a strong odour in the sun, that was just about to set, and shone
      right in the old people's faces. They both looked so rosy-cheeked; and the
      youngest of the grandchildren danced around them, and called out quite
      delighted, that there was to be something very splendid that evening&mdash;they
      were all to have hot potatoes. And old Nanny nodded in the bush, and
      shouted 'hurrah!' with the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is no fairy tale,&rdquo; said the little boy, who was listening to the
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is, you must understand it,&rdquo; said the narrator; &ldquo;let us ask old
      Nanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was no fairy tale, 'tis true,&rdquo; said old Nanny; &ldquo;but now it's coming.
      The most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is reality; were
      that not the case, you know, my magnificent Elderbush could not have grown
      out of the tea-pot.&rdquo; And then she took the little boy out of bed, laid him
      on her bosom, and the branches of the Elder Tree, full of flowers, closed
      around her. They sat in an aerial dwelling, and it flew with them through
      the air. Oh, it was wondrous beautiful! Old Nanny had grown all of a
      sudden a young and pretty maiden; but her robe was still the same green
      stuff with white flowers, which she had worn before. On her bosom she had
      a real Elderflower, and in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers;
      her eyes were so large and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them;
      she kissed the boy, and now they were of the same age and felt alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand in hand they went out of the bower, and they were standing in the
      beautiful garden of their home. Near the green lawn papa's walking-stick
      was tied, and for the little ones it seemed to be endowed with life; for
      as soon as they got astride it, the round polished knob was turned into a
      magnificent neighing head, a long black mane fluttered in the breeze, and
      four slender yet strong legs shot out. The animal was strong and handsome,
      and away they went at full gallop round the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huzza! Now we are riding miles off,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;We are riding away to
      the castle where we were last year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on they rode round the grass-plot; and the little maiden, who, we
      know, was no one else but old Nanny, kept on crying out, &ldquo;Now we are in
      the country! Don't you see the farm-house yonder? And there is an Elder
      Tree standing beside it; and the cock is scraping away the earth for the
      hens, look, how he struts! And now we are close to the church. It lies
      high upon the hill, between the large oak-trees, one of which is half
      decayed. And now we are by the smithy, where the fire is blazing, and
      where the half-naked men are banging with their hammers till the sparks
      fly about. Away! away! To the beautiful country-seat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all that the little maiden, who sat behind on the stick, spoke of,
      flew by in reality. The boy saw it all, and yet they were only going round
      the grass-plot. Then they played in a side avenue, and marked out a little
      garden on the earth; and they took Elder-blossoms from their hair, planted
      them, and they grew just like those the old people planted when they were
      children, as related before. They went hand in hand, as the old people had
      done when they were children; but not to the Round Tower, or to
      Friedericksberg; no, the little damsel wound her arms round the boy, and
      then they flew far away through all Denmark. And spring came, and summer;
      and then it was autumn, and then winter; and a thousand pictures were
      reflected in the eye and in the heart of the boy; and the little girl
      always sang to him, &ldquo;This you will never forget.&rdquo; And during their whole
      flight the Elder Tree smelt so sweet and odorous; he remarked the roses
      and the fresh beeches, but the Elder Tree had a more wondrous fragrance,
      for its flowers hung on the breast of the little maiden; and there, too,
      did he often lay his head during the flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lovely here in spring!&rdquo; said the young maiden. And they stood in a
      beech-wood that had just put on its first green, where the woodroof [*] at
      their feet sent forth its fragrance, and the pale-red anemony looked so
      pretty among the verdure. &ldquo;Oh, would it were always spring in the
      sweetly-smelling Danish beech-forests!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Asperula odorata.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lovely here in summer!&rdquo; said she. And she flew past old castles of
      by-gone days of chivalry, where the red walls and the embattled gables
      were mirrored in the canal, where the swans were swimming, and peered up
      into the old cool avenues. In the fields the corn was waving like the sea;
      in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing; while wild-drone
      flowers, and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the hedges; and
      towards evening the moon rose round and large, and the haycocks in the
      meadows smelt so sweetly. &ldquo;This one never forgets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lovely here in autumn!&rdquo; said the little maiden. And suddenly the
      atmosphere grew as blue again as before; the forest grew red, and green,
      and yellow-colored. The dogs came leaping along, and whole flocks of
      wild-fowl flew over the cairn, where blackberry-bushes were hanging round
      the old stones. The sea was dark blue, covered with ships full of white
      sails; and in the barn old women, maidens, and children were sitting
      picking hops into a large cask; the young sang songs, but the old told
      fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers. Nothing could be more
      charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is delightful here in winter!&rdquo; said the little maiden. And all the
      trees were covered with hoar-frost; they looked like white corals; the
      snow crackled under foot, as if one had new boots on; and one falling star
      after the other was seen in the sky. The Christmas-tree was lighted in the
      room; presents were there, and good-humor reigned. In the country the
      violin sounded in the room of the peasant; the newly-baked cakes were
      attacked; even the poorest child said, &ldquo;It is really delightful here in
      winter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was delightful; and the little maiden showed the boy everything;
      and the Elder Tree still was fragrant, and the red flag, with the white
      cross, was still waving: the flag under which the old seaman in the New
      Booths had sailed. And the boy grew up to be a lad, and was to go forth in
      the wide world-far, far away to warm lands, where the coffee-tree grows;
      but at his departure the little maiden took an Elder-blossom from her
      bosom, and gave it him to keep; and it was placed between the leaves of
      his Prayer-Book; and when in foreign lands he opened the book, it was
      always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay; and the more he looked
      at it, the fresher it became; he felt as it were, the fragrance of the
      Danish groves; and from among the leaves of the flowers he could
      distinctly see the little maiden, peeping forth with her bright blue eyes&mdash;and
      then she whispered, &ldquo;It is delightful here in Spring, Summer, Autumn, and
      Winter&rdquo;; and a hundred visions glided before his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed many years, and he was now an old man, and sat with his old
      wife under the blooming tree. They held each other by the hand, as the old
      grand-father and grand-mother yonder in the New Booths did, and they
      talked exactly like them of old times, and of the fiftieth anniversary of
      their wedding. The little maiden, with the blue eyes, and with
      Elder-blossoms in her hair, sat in the tree, nodded to both of them, and
      said, &ldquo;To-day is the fiftieth anniversary!&rdquo; And then she took two flowers
      out of her hair, and kissed them. First, they shone like silver, then like
      gold; and when they laid them on the heads of the old people, each flower
      became a golden crown. So there they both sat, like a king and a queen,
      under the fragrant tree, that looked exactly like an elder: the old man
      told his wife the story of &ldquo;Old Nanny,&rdquo; as it had been told him when a
      boy. And it seemed to both of them it contained much that resembled their
      own history; and those parts that were like it pleased them best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus it is,&rdquo; said the little maiden in the tree, &ldquo;some call me 'Old
      Nanny,' others a 'Dryad,' but, in reality, my name is 'Remembrance'; 'tis
      I who sit in the tree that grows and grows! I can remember; I can tell
      things! Let me see if you have my flower still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old man opened his Prayer-Book. There lay the Elder-blossom, as
      fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before; and
      Remembrance nodded, and the old people, decked with crowns of gold, sat in
      the flush of the evening sun. They closed their eyes, and&mdash;and&mdash;!
      Yes, that's the end of the story!
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy lay in his bed; he did not know if he had dreamed or not,
      or if he had been listening while someone told him the story. The tea-pot
      was standing on the table, but no Elder Tree was growing out of it! And
      the old man, who had been talking, was just on the point of going out at
      the door, and he did go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid that was!&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;Mother, I have been to warm
      countries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should think,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;When one has drunk two good cupfuls
      of Elder-flower tea, 'tis likely enough one goes into warm climates&rdquo;; and
      she tucked him up nicely, least he should take cold. &ldquo;You have had a good
      sleep while I have been sitting here, and arguing with him whether it was
      a story or a fairy tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is old Nanny?&rdquo; asked the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the tea-pot,&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;and there she may remain.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE BELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      People said &ldquo;The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting.&rdquo; For a
      strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town. It
      was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a moment,
      for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude made too
      great a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were
      farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see the
      evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much more
      distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still forest;
      people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long time passed, and people said to each other&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if there
      is a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet;
      let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer.&rdquo; And the rich people
      drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely long to them;
      and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the skirts of the
      forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long branches, and fancied
      they were now in the depth of the green wood. The confectioner of the town
      came out, and set up his booth there; and soon after came another
      confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as a sign or ornament, but
      it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to preserve it from the rain.
      When all the people returned home, they said it had been very romantic,
      and that it was quite a different sort of thing to a pic-nic or tea-party.
      There were three persons who asserted they had penetrated to the end of
      the forest, and that they had always heard the wonderful sounds of the
      bell, but it had seemed to them as if it had come from the town. One wrote
      a whole poem about it, and said the bell sounded like the voice of a
      mother to a good dear child, and that no melody was sweeter than the tones
      of the bell. The king of the country was also observant of it, and vowed
      that he who could discover whence the sounds proceeded, should have the
      title of &ldquo;Universal Bell-ringer,&rdquo; even if it were not really a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place, but
      one only returned with a sort of explanation; for nobody went far enough,
      that one not further than the others. However, he said that the sound
      proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of learned owl,
      that continually knocked its head against the branches. But whether the
      sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no one could say
      with certainty. So now he got the place of &ldquo;Universal Bell-ringer,&rdquo; and
      wrote yearly a short treatise &ldquo;On the Owl&rdquo;; but everybody was just as wise
      as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly,
      the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was an eventful
      day for them; from children they become all at once grown-up-persons; it
      was as if their infant souls were now to fly all at once into persons with
      more understanding. The sun was shining gloriously; the children that had
      been confirmed went out of the town; and from the wood was borne towards
      them the sounds of the unknown bell with wonderful distinctness. They all
      immediately felt a wish to go thither; all except three. One of them had
      to go home to try on a ball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball
      which had caused her to be confirmed this time, for otherwise she would
      not have come; the other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and
      boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them
      back by a certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange
      place if his parents were not with him&mdash;that he had always been a
      good boy hitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and
      that one ought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make
      fun of him, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three, therefore, that did not go; the others hastened on. The
      sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held the
      other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office, and
      were all of equal rank in the eye of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two of the youngest soon grew tired, and both returned to town; two
      little girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either; and
      when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was, they
      said, &ldquo;Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is only a
      fancy that people have taken into their heads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and
      solemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. It was
      so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite fatiguing to
      proceed. Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming
      convolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to
      tree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was
      very beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would
      get so torn. Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of every
      color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That surely cannot be the bell,&rdquo; said one of the children, lying down and
      listening. &ldquo;This must be looked to.&rdquo; So he remained, and let the others go
      on without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They afterwards came to a little house, made of branches and the bark of
      trees; a large wild apple-tree bent over it, as if it would shower down
      all its blessings on the roof, where roses were blooming. The long stems
      twined round the gable, on which there hung a small bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it that which people had heard? Yes, everybody was unanimous on the
      subject, except one, who said that the bell was too small and too fine to
      be heard at so great a distance, and besides it was very different tones
      to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. It was a king's
      son who spoke; whereon the others said, &ldquo;Such people always want to be
      wiser than everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They now let him go on alone; and as he went, his breast was filled more
      and more with the forest solitude; but he still heard the little bell with
      which the others were so satisfied, and now and then, when the wind blew,
      he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea where the
      confectioner had his tent; but the deep sound of the bell rose louder; it
      was almost as if an organ were accompanying it, and the tones came from
      the left hand, the side where the heart is placed. A rustling was heard in
      the bushes, and a little boy stood before the King's Son, a boy in wooden
      shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what long wrists he
      had. Both knew each other: the boy was that one among the children who
      could not come because he had to go home and return his jacket and boots
      to the innkeeper's son. This he had done, and was now going on in wooden
      shoes and in his humble dress, for the bell sounded with so deep a tone,
      and with such strange power, that proceed he must.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, we can go together,&rdquo; said the King's Son. But the poor child
      that had been confirmed was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden shoes,
      pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he
      could not walk so fast; besides, he thought that the bell must be looked
      for to the right; for that was the place where all sorts of beautiful
      things were to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there we shall not meet,&rdquo; said the King's Son, nodding at the same
      time to the poor boy, who went into the darkest, thickest part of the
      wood, where thorns tore his humble dress, and scratched his face and hands
      and feet till they bled. The King's Son got some scratches too; but the
      sun shone on his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he was an
      excellent and resolute youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must and will find the bell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even if I am obliged to go to
      the end of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ugly apes sat upon the trees, and grinned. &ldquo;Shall we thrash him?&rdquo; said
      they. &ldquo;Shall we thrash him? He is the son of a king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on he went, without being disheartened, deeper and deeper into the
      wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing. There stood white
      lilies with blood-red stamina, skyblue tulips, which shone as they waved
      in the winds, and apple-trees, the apples of which looked exactly like
      large soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the
      sunshine! Around the nicest green meads, where the deer were playing in
      the grass, grew magnificent oaks and beeches; and if the bark of one of
      the trees was cracked, there grass and long creeping plants grew in the
      crevices. And there were large calm lakes there too, in which white swans
      were swimming, and beat the air with their wings. The King's Son often
      stood still and listened. He thought the bell sounded from the depths of
      these still lakes; but then he remarked again that the tone proceeded not
      from there, but farther off, from out the depths of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. It was still in the
      woods, so very still; and he fell on his knees, sung his evening hymn, and
      said: &ldquo;I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down, and night is
      coming&mdash;the dark, dark night. Yet perhaps I may be able once more to
      see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. I will climb up
      yonder rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of trees&mdash;climbed
      up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing and the toads
      were croaking&mdash;and he gained the summit before the sun had quite gone
      down. How magnificent was the sight from this height! The sea&mdash;the
      great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long waves against the coast&mdash;was
      stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet, stood the
      sun, like a large shining altar, all melted together in the most glowing
      colors. And the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing, and his heart
      sang with the rest: all nature was a vast holy church, in which the trees
      and the buoyant clouds were the pillars, flowers and grass the velvet
      carpeting, and heaven itself the large cupola. The red colors above faded
      away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were lighted, a million
      lamps shone; and the King's Son spread out his arms towards heaven, and
      wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by a path to the right,
      appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor boy who had been
      confirmed with him. He had followed his own path, and had reached the spot
      just as soon as the son of the king had done. They ran towards each other,
      and stood together hand in hand in the vast church of nature and of
      poetry, while over them sounded the invisible holy bell: blessed spirits
      floated around them, and lifted up their voices in a rejoicing hallelujah!

    </div>
    <h2>
      THE OLD HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the street, up there, was an old, a very old house&mdash;it was almost
      three hundred years old, for that might be known by reading the great beam
      on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips and
      hop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times, and over
      every window was a distorted face cut out in the beam. The one story stood
      forward a great way over the other; and directly under the eaves was a
      leaden spout with a dragon's head; the rain-water should have run out of
      the mouth, but it ran out of the belly, for there was a hole in the spout.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the other houses in the street were so new and so neat, with large
      window panes and smooth walls, one could easily see that they would have
      nothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought, &ldquo;How long is
      that old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? And
      then the projecting windows stand so far out, that no one can see from our
      windows what happens in that direction! The steps are as broad as those of
      a palace, and as high as to a church tower. The iron railings look just
      like the door to an old family vault, and then they have brass tops&mdash;that's
      so stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the street were also new and neat houses, and they
      thought just as the others did; but at the window opposite the old house
      there sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes: he
      certainly liked the old house best, and that both in sunshine and
      moonshine. And when he looked across at the wall where the mortar had
      fallen out, he could sit and find out there the strangest figures
      imaginable; exactly as the street had appeared before, with steps,
      projecting windows, and pointed gables; he could see soldiers with
      halberds, and spouts where the water ran, like dragons and serpents. That
      was a house to look at; and there lived an old man, who wore plush
      breeches; and he had a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig that one
      could see was a real wig. Every morning there came an old fellow to him
      who put his rooms in order, and went on errands; otherwise, the old man in
      the plush breeches was quite alone in the old house. Now and then he came
      to the window and looked out, and the little boy nodded to him, and the
      old man nodded again, and so they became acquaintances, and then they were
      friends, although they had never spoken to each other&mdash;but that made
      no difference. The little boy heard his parents say, &ldquo;The old man opposite
      is very well off, but he is so very, very lonely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up in
      a piece of paper, went downstairs, and stood in the doorway; and when the
      man who went on errands came past, he said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me? I
      have two pewter soldiers&mdash;this is one of them, and he shall have it,
      for I know he is so very, very lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewter
      soldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message; it was to
      ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a visit;
      and so he got permission of his parents, and then went over to the old
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever;
      one would have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and it
      was as if the carved-out trumpeters&mdash;for there were trumpeters, who
      stood in tulips, carved out on the door&mdash;blew with all their might,
      their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before. Yes, they blew&mdash;&ldquo;Trateratra!
      The little boy comes! Trateratra!&rdquo;&mdash;and then the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and ladies
      in silken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns rustled! And
      then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way upwards, and a
      little way downwards, and then one came on a balcony which was in a very
      dilapidated state, sure enough, with large holes and long crevices, but
      grass grew there and leaves out of them altogether, for the whole balcony
      outside, the yard, and the walls, were overgrown with so much green stuff,
      that it looked like a garden; only a balcony. Here stood old flower-pots
      with faces and asses' ears, and the flowers grew just as they liked. One
      of the pots was quite overrun on all sides with pinks, that is to say,
      with the green part; shoot stood by shoot, and it said quite distinctly,
      &ldquo;The air has cherished me, the sun has kissed me, and promised me a little
      flower on Sunday! a little flower on Sunday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog's
      leather, and printed with gold flowers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;The gilding decays,
   But hog's leather stays!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      said the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and
      with arms on both sides. &ldquo;Sit down! sit down!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;Ugh! how I
      creak; now I shall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress,
      ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows
      were, and where the old man sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!&rdquo; said the old man.
      &ldquo;And I thank you because you come over to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thankee! thankee!&rdquo; or &ldquo;cranky! cranky!&rdquo; sounded from all the furniture;
      there was so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to
      get a look at the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, so
      young, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that
      stood quite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said &ldquo;thankee,
      thankee!&rdquo; nor &ldquo;cranky, cranky!&rdquo; but looked with her mild eyes at the
      little boy, who directly asked the old man, &ldquo;Where did you get her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder, at the broker's,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;where there are so many
      pictures hanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of
      them buried; but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and
      gone these fifty years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of withered
      flowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!
    </p>
    <p>
      The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, and
      everything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say at home,&rdquo; said the little boy, &ldquo;that you are so very, very
      lonely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come
      and visit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there were
      whole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which
      one never sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens
      with waving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by
      two lions&mdash;and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an
      eagle that had two heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that
      they can say, it is a pair! Yes, that was a picture book!
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, and
      nuts&mdash;yes, it was delightful over there in the old house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bear it any longer!&rdquo; said the pewter soldier, who sat on the
      drawers. &ldquo;It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in a
      family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it
      any longer! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer!
      Here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your
      father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet
      children made such a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is&mdash;do
      you think that he gets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a
      Christmas tree? He will get nothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not let it grieve you so much,&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;I find it
      so very delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may
      bring with them, they come and visit here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know
      them!&rdquo; said the pewter soldier. &ldquo;I cannot bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must!&rdquo; said the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the most
      delicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no
      more about the pewter soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passed
      away, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and
      then the little boy went over there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carved trumpeters blew, &ldquo;Trateratra! There is the little boy!
      Trateratra!&rdquo; and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled,
      and the silk gowns rustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs
      had the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was
      exactly like the first time, for over there one day and hour was just like
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bear it!&rdquo; said the pewter soldier. &ldquo;I have shed pewter tears! It
      is too melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It
      would at least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it
      is to have a visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with
      them! I have had a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant
      thing in the end; I was at last about to jump down from the drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were
      here; it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the
      table and sung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly
      with folded hands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the
      door was opened, and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and
      who always dances when she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may
      be, was put into the room&mdash;though she ought not to have been there&mdash;and
      then she began to dance, but could not keep time, because the tones were
      so long; and then she stood, first on the one leg, and bent her head
      forwards, and then on the other leg, and bent her head forwards&mdash;but
      all would not do. You stood very seriously all together, although it was
      difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and then I fell off the table,
      and got a bump, which I have still&mdash;for it was not right of me to
      laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, and everything
      that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with what they
      may bring with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little
      Mary! And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is
      happy enough, that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are given away as a present!&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;You must remain.
      Can you not understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen,
      both &ldquo;tin boxes&rdquo; and &ldquo;balsam boxes,&rdquo; old cards, so large and so gilded,
      such as one never sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the
      piano was opened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was
      so hoarse when the old man played on it! and then he hummed a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she could sing that!&rdquo; said he, and nodded to the portrait, which he
      had bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!&rdquo; shouted the pewter soldier
      as loud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the
      floor. What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought;
      he was away, and he stayed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall find him!&rdquo; said the old man; but he never found him. The floor
      was too open&mdash;the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and
      there he lay as in an open tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, and
      several weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was
      obliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old
      house, and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work and
      inscriptions; it lay quite up over the steps, just as if there was no one
      at home&mdash;nor was there any one at home&mdash;the old man was dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne
      into it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in
      his grave. He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends
      were dead, and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was
      driven away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little
      boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old
      ladies away, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the
      old clothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the
      portrait of her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's
      again; and there it hung, for no one knew her more&mdash;no one cared
      about the old picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a
      ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with the
      hog's-leather hanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and
      leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then
      it was put to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a relief,&rdquo; said the neighboring houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls;
      but before it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden
      laid out, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house.
      Before the garden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it
      looked quite splendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the
      sparrows hung by scores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as
      well as they could, but it was not about the old house, for they could not
      remember it, so many years had passed&mdash;so many that the little boy
      had grown up to a whole man, yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his
      parents; and he had just been married, and, together with his little wife,
      had come to live in the house here, where the garden was; and he stood by
      her there whilst she planted a field-flower that she found so pretty; she
      planted it with her little hand, and pressed the earth around it with her
      fingers. Oh! what was that? She had stuck herself. There sat something
      pointed, straight out of the soft mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was&mdash;yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at
      the old man's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the
      rubbish, and had at last laid for many years in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf,
      and then with her fine handkerchief&mdash;it had such a delightful smell,
      that it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see him,&rdquo; said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head.
      &ldquo;Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldier
      which I had when I was a little boy!&rdquo; And then he told his wife about the
      old house, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over
      to him because he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as
      it had really been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young
      wife, on account of the old house and the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!&rdquo; said
      she. &ldquo;I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but
      you must show me the old man's grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not know it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and no one knows it! All his friends
      were dead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very, very lonely he must have been!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, very lonely!&rdquo; said the pewter soldier. &ldquo;But it is delightful not to
      be forgotten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewter
      soldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had
      lost all its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an
      opinion, and it gave it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;The gilding decays,
   But hog's leather stays!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This the pewter soldier did not believe.

    <h2>
      THE HAPPY FAMILY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one
      holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over
      one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for it
      is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there
      grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this
      delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of
      quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, &ldquo;Hem, hem! how
      delicious!&rdquo; for they thought it tasted so delicate&mdash;lived on
      dock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they
      were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and grew
      all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery over
      them&mdash;it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an
      apple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was a
      garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old
      snails.
    </p>
    <p>
      They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember very
      well that there had been many more; that they were of a family from
      foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted.
      They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was still
      something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and that
      there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then placed
      on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in fact,
      what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could not
      possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly
      genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they
      asked about it could give them any information&mdash;none of them had been
      boiled or laid on a silver dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the world,
      that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the manor-house
      was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children
      themselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up
      as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a common
      family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought they could
      observe how he increased in size, and she begged father, if he could not
      see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's shell; and then he
      felt it, and found the good dame was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day there was a heavy storm of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves!&rdquo; said Father Snail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are also rain-drops!&rdquo; said Mother Snail. &ldquo;And now the rain pours
      right down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very
      happy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has his
      also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure enough;
      but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world? We are
      provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is planted
      for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and what there is
      outside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing at all,&rdquo; said Father Snail. &ldquo;No place can be better than
      ours, and I have nothing to wish for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the dame. &ldquo;I would willingly go to the manorhouse, be boiled,
      and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated so; there
      is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!&rdquo; said Father Snail. &ldquo;Or
      the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. There
      need not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a
      tremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he
      not been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache
      when I look up to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not scold him,&rdquo; said Mother Snail. &ldquo;He creeps so carefully; he
      will afford us much pleasure&mdash;and we have nothing but him to live
      for! But have you not thought of it? Where shall we get a wife for him? Do
      you not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in
      the interior of the burdock forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of,&rdquo; said the old one. &ldquo;Black
      snails without a house&mdash;but they are so common, and so conceited. But
      we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run to and
      fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a wife for
      our little snail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know one, sure enough&mdash;the most charming one!&rdquo; said one of the
      ants. &ldquo;But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing!&rdquo; said the old folks. &ldquo;Has she a house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a palace!&rdquo; said the ant. &ldquo;The finest ant's palace, with seven
      hundred passages!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you!&rdquo; said Mother Snail. &ldquo;Our son shall not go into an ant-hill;
      if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the commission to the
      white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and sunshine; they know the
      whole forest here, both within and without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a wife for him,&rdquo; said the gnats. &ldquo;At a hundred human paces from
      here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she is
      quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred human
      paces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let her come to him!&rdquo; said the old ones. &ldquo;He has a whole
      forest of burdocks, she has only a bush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week before
      she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one could thus
      see that she was of the same species.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as
      they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the old
      folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made a
      brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much affected;
      and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole forest of
      burdocks, and said&mdash;what they had always said&mdash;that it was the
      best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and increased
      and multiplied, they and their children would once in the course of time
      come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on silver dishes. After
      this speech was made, the old ones crept into their shells, and never more
      came out. They slept; the young couple governed in the forest, and had a
      numerous progeny, but they were never boiled, and never came on the silver
      dishes; so from this they concluded that the manor-house had fallen to
      ruins, and that all the men in the world were extinct; and as no one
      contradicted them, so, of course it was so. And the rain beat on the
      dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake, and the sun shone in order
      to give the burdock forest a color for their sakes; and they were very
      happy, and the whole family was happy; for they, indeed were so.

    <h2>
      THE STORY OF A MOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      A mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so afraid
      that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves,
      and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration,
      as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more sorrowfully on the
      little creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped
      up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed it, as it
      was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was covered with ice
      and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment,
      the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove,
      that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle, and
      the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick
      child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think that I shall save him?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Our Lord will not
      take him from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old man&mdash;it was Death himself&mdash;he nodded so strangely,
      it could just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her
      lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy&mdash;she
      had not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now she slept, but
      only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man was
      gone, and her little child was gone&mdash;he had taken it with him; and
      the old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight
      ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black
      clothes; and she said, &ldquo;Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him
      hasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and he
      never brings back what he takes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, only tell me which way he went!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Tell me the way,
      and I shall find him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; said the woman in the black clothes. &ldquo;But before I tell it,
      thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child! I
      am fond of them. I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw thy tears
      whilst thou sang'st them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sing them all, all!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;But do not stop me now&mdash;I
      may overtake him&mdash;I may find my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and
      wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then Night
      said, &ldquo;Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw Death
      take his way with thy little child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no
      longer knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush; there
      was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter season,
      and ice-flakes hung on the branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the thorn-bush; &ldquo;but I will not tell thee which way he took,
      unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death; I
      shall become a lump of ice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might be
      thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her blood
      flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves,
      and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart of the
      afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way she
      should go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat. The
      lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open, nor low
      enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must go if she
      would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and that was
      an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother thought that
      a miracle might happen nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!&rdquo; said the weeping mother;
      and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the
      waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up, as if
      she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the
      opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not
      if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up;
      but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not come here yet!&rdquo; said the old grave woman, who was appointed to
      look after Death's great greenhouse! &ldquo;How have you been able to find the
      way hither? And who has helped you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OUR LORD has helped me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is merciful, and you will also be
      so! Where shall I find my little child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I know not,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;and you cannot see! Many flowers and
      trees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over
      again! You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree or
      flower, just as everyone happens to be settled; they look like other
      plants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can also
      beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's; but what will you
      give me if I tell you what you shall do more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to give,&rdquo; said the afflicted mother, &ldquo;but I will go to the
      world's end for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I have nothing to do there!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;But you can give me
      your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that I like!
      You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you demand nothing else?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;That I will gladly give you!&rdquo; And
      she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white hair
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew
      strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells,
      and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants, some so
      fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black
      crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and
      plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every
      flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human frame still
      lived&mdash;one in China, and another in Greenland&mdash;round about in
      the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so
      stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other places, there was
      a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was
      so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down over all the
      smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat; and
      amongst millions she knew her child's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue
      crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch the flower!&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;But place yourself here,
      and when Death comes&mdash;I expect him every moment&mdash;do not let him
      pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the
      others. Then he will be afraid! He is responsible for them to OUR LORD,
      and no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind
      mother could feel that it was Death that came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How couldst
      thou come quicker than I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a mother,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower, but
      she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she
      should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and she felt
      that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst not do anything against me!&rdquo; said Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But OUR LORD can!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only do His bidding!&rdquo; said Death. &ldquo;I am His gardener, I take all His
      flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise, in
      the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare not
      tell thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me back my child!&rdquo; said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At once
      she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and
      cried out to Death, &ldquo;I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in
      despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch them not!&rdquo; said Death. &ldquo;Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and
      now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another mother!&rdquo; said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of
      both the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, thou hast thine eyes,&rdquo; said Death; &ldquo;I fished them up from the
      lake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again,
      they are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well close
      by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst have torn
      up, and thou wilt see their whole future life&mdash;their whole human
      existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the
      one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy were
      felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and
      distress, horror, and wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of them are God's will!&rdquo; said Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?&rdquo;
       asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will not tell thee,&rdquo; said Death; &ldquo;but this thou shalt know from
      me, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou
      saw'st&mdash;thy own child's future life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the mother screamed with terror, &ldquo;Which of them was my child? Tell it
      me! Save the innocent! Save my child from all that misery! Rather take it
      away! Take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my prayers, and
      all that I have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand thee!&rdquo; said Death. &ldquo;Wilt thou have thy child again,
      or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our
      Lord: &ldquo;Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best!
      hear me not! hear me not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and went
      with it into the unknown land.

    <h2>
      THE FALSE COLLAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a fine gentleman, all of whose moveables were a boot-jack
      and a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world; and it
      is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened that it
      came to be washed in company with a garter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;I never did see anything so slender and so fine,
      so soft and so neat. May I not ask your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall not tell you!&rdquo; said the garter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; asked the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange
      question to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly a girdle,&rdquo; said the collar; &ldquo;that is to say an inside
      girdle. I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will thank you not to speak to me,&rdquo; said the garter. &ldquo;I think I have
      not given the least occasion for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! When one is as handsome as you,&rdquo; said the collar, &ldquo;that is occasion
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't come so near me, I beg of you!&rdquo; said the garter. &ldquo;You look so much
      like those men-folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am also a fine gentleman,&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;I have a bootjack and a
      hair-comb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that was not true, for it was his master who had them: but he boasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't come so near me,&rdquo; said the garter: &ldquo;I am not accustomed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prude!&rdquo; exclaimed the collar; and then it was taken out of the
      washing-tub. It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the
      sunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm
      box-iron. &ldquo;Dear lady!&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;Dear widow-lady! I feel quite
      hot. I am quite changed. I begin to unfold myself. You will burn a hole in
      me. Oh! I offer you my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rag!&rdquo; said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she
      fancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw the
      waggons. &ldquo;Rag!&rdquo; said the box-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long scissors
      to cut off the jagged part. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;You are certainly the
      first opera dancer. How well you can stretch your legs out! It is the most
      graceful performance I have ever seen. No one can imitate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve to be a baroness,&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;All that I have is a
      fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the barony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you seek my hand?&rdquo; said the scissors; for she was angry; and without
      more ado, she CUT HIM, and then he was condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. It is surprising how well
      you preserve your teeth, Miss,&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;Have you never thought
      of being betrothed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course! you may be sure of that,&rdquo; said the hair-comb. &ldquo;I AM
      betrothed&mdash;to the boot-jack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betrothed!&rdquo; exclaimed the collar. Now there was no other to court, and so
      he despised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long time passed away, then the collar came into the rag chest at the
      paper mill; there was a large company of rags, the fine by themselves, and
      the coarse by themselves, just as it should be. They all had much to say,
      but the collar the most; for he was a real boaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had such an immense number of sweethearts!&rdquo; said the collar. &ldquo;I
      could not be in peace! It is true, I was always a fine starched-up
      gentleman! I had both a boot-jack and a hair-comb, which I never used! You
      should have seen me then, you should have seen me when I lay down! I shall
      never forget MY FIRST LOVE&mdash;she was a girdle, so fine, so soft, and
      so charming, she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake! There was
      also a widow, who became glowing hot, but I left her standing till she got
      black again; there was also the first opera dancer, she gave me that cut
      which I now go with, she was so ferocious! My own hair-comb was in love
      with me, she lost all her teeth from the heart-ache; yes, I have lived to
      see much of that sort of thing; but I am extremely sorry for the garter&mdash;I
      mean the girdle&mdash;that went into the water-tub. I have much on my
      conscience, I want to become white paper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the
      collar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see, and on
      which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so terribly
      afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well for us to
      beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can never know if
      we may not, in the course of time, also come into the rag chest, and be
      made into white paper, and then have our whole life's history printed on
      it, even the most secret, and be obliged to run about and tell it
      ourselves, just like this collar.

    <h2>
      THE SHADOW
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough! there the people
      become quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the HOTTEST lands they are burnt
      to Negroes. But now it was only to the HOT lands that a learned man had
      come from the cold; there he thought that he could run about just as when
      at home, but he soon found out his mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors&mdash;the
      window-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if the
      whole house slept, or there was no one at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine
      must fall there from morning till evening&mdash;it was really not to be
      borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned man from the cold lands&mdash;he was a young man, and seemed
      to be a clever man&mdash;sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he
      became quite meagre&mdash;even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also
      an effect on it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that
      they began to freshen up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on
      all the balconies in the street&mdash;for one must have air, even if one
      be accustomed to be mahogany!* It was lively both up and down the street.
      Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the street&mdash;chairs
      and tables were brought forth&mdash;and candles burnt&mdash;yes, above a
      thousand lights were burning&mdash;and the one talked and the other sung;
      and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with a
      dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys were
      screaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and
      detonating balls&mdash;and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers&mdash;for
      there were funerals with psalm and hymn&mdash;and then the din of
      carriages driving and company arriving: yes, it was, in truth, lively
      enough down in the street. Only in that single house, which stood opposite
      that in which the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet
      some one lived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony&mdash;they
      grew so well in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they
      were watered&mdash;and some one must water them&mdash;there must be
      somebody there. The door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but
      it was dark within, at least in the front room; further in there was heard
      the sound of music. The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but
      now&mdash;it might be that he only imagined it&mdash;for he found
      everything marvellous out there, in the warm lands, if there had only been
      no sun. The stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the
      house opposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared
      to him to be extremely tiresome. &ldquo;It is as if some one sat there, and
      practised a piece that he could not master&mdash;always the same piece. 'I
      shall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he
      plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      * The word mahogany can be understood, in Danish, as having two meanings.
      In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in jest, it
      signifies &ldquo;excessively fine,&rdquo; which arose from an anecdote of Nyboder, in
      Copenhagen, (the seamen's quarter.) A sailor's wife, who was always proud
      and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and complained that she had
      got a splinter in her finger. &ldquo;What of?&rdquo; asked the neighbor's wife. &ldquo;It is
      a mahogany splinter,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Mahogany! It cannot be less with
      you!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman&mdash;and thence the proverb, &ldquo;It is so
      mahogany!&rdquo;&mdash;(that is, so excessively fine)&mdash;is derived.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night the stranger awoke&mdash;he slept with the doors of the balcony
      open&mdash;the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought
      that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the
      flowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the midst
      of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden&mdash;it was as if she
      also shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them quite wide&mdash;yes,
      he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he crept gently
      behind the curtain, but the maiden was gone; the flowers shone no longer,
      but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever; the door was ajar, and,
      far within, the music sounded so soft and delightful, one could really
      melt away in sweet thoughts from it. Yet it was like a piece of
      enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the actual entrance? The whole
      of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and there people could not always
      be running through.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the
      room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should fall
      on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat, directly opposite,
      between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger moved, the
      shadow also moved: for that it always does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,&rdquo; said the
      learned man. &ldquo;See, how nicely it sits between the flowers. The door stands
      half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into the room, look
      about, and then come and tell me what it had seen. Come, now! Be useful,
      and do me a service,&rdquo; said he, in jest. &ldquo;Have the kindness to step in.
      Now! Art thou going?&rdquo; and then he nodded to the shadow, and the shadow
      nodded again. &ldquo;Well then, go! But don't stay away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony rose
      also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round. Yes! if
      anyone had paid particular attention to it, they would have seen, quite
      distinctly, that the shadow went in through the half-open balcony-door of
      their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went into his own room, and
      let the long curtain fall down after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the
      newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said he, as he came out into the sunshine. &ldquo;I have no
      shadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come again. It
      is really tiresome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because he
      knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known to
      everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now came
      there and told his story, they would say that he was imitating it, and
      that he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk about it at all;
      and that was wisely thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the light
      directly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always have its
      master for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made himself little;
      he made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, &ldquo;Hem! hem!&rdquo; but
      it was of no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was vexatious; but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly; and
      after the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that a new
      shadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had a very
      fair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the northern lands,
      grew more and more in the journey, so that at last it was so long and so
      large, that it was more than sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned man then came home, and he wrote books about what was true in
      the world, and about what was good and what was beautiful; and there
      passed days and years&mdash;yes! many years passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as he was sitting in his room, there was a gentle knocking at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said he; but no one came in; so he opened the door, and there
      stood before him such an extremely lean man, that he felt quite strange.
      As to the rest, the man was very finely dressed&mdash;he must be a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom have I the honor of speaking?&rdquo; asked the learned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I thought as much,&rdquo; said the fine man. &ldquo;I thought you would not know
      me. I have got so much body. I have even got flesh and clothes. You
      certainly never thought of seeing me so well off. Do you not know your old
      shadow? You certainly thought I should never more return. Things have gone
      on well with me since I was last with you. I have, in all respects, become
      very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from service? If so, I can do
      it&rdquo;; and then he rattled a whole bunch of valuable seals that hung to his
      watch, and he stuck his hand in the thick gold chain he wore around his
      neck&mdash;nay! how all his fingers glittered with diamond rings; and then
      all were pure gems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay; I cannot recover from my surprise!&rdquo; said the learned man. &ldquo;What is
      the meaning of all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something common, is it not,&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;But you yourself do not
      belong to the common order; and I, as you know well, have from a child
      followed in your footsteps. As soon as you found I was capable to go out
      alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most brilliant
      circumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once
      more before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also wished to see this
      land again&mdash;for you know we always love our native land. I know you
      have got another shadow again; have I anything to pay to it or you? If so,
      you will oblige me by saying what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, is it really thou?&rdquo; said the learned man. &ldquo;It is most remarkable: I
      never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what I have to pay,&rdquo; said the shadow; &ldquo;for I don't like to be in
      any sort of debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How canst thou talk so?&rdquo; said the learned man. &ldquo;What debt is there to
      talk about? Make thyself as free as anyone else. I am extremely glad to
      hear of thy good fortune: sit down, old friend, and tell me a little how
      it has gone with thee, and what thou hast seen at our opposite neighbor's
      there&mdash;in the warm lands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will tell you all about it,&rdquo; said the shadow, and sat down: &ldquo;but
      then you must also promise me, that, wherever you may meet me, you will
      never say to anyone here in the town that I have been your shadow. I
      intend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite at thy ease about that,&rdquo; said the learned man; &ldquo;I shall not say
      to anyone who thou actually art: here is my hand&mdash;I promise it, and a
      man's bond is his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word is a shadow,&rdquo; said the shadow, &ldquo;and as such it must speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was dressed
      entirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent leather
      boots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was bare crown
      and brim; not to speak of what we already know it had&mdash;seals, gold
      neck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was well-dressed, and it
      was just that which made it quite a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I shall tell you my adventures,&rdquo; said the shadow; and then he sat,
      with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of the learned
      man's new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet. Now this was
      perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the ground kept itself so still
      and quiet, that it might hear all that passed: it wished to know how it
      could get free, and work its way up, so as to become its own master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?&rdquo; said the shadow.
      &ldquo;It was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy! I was there for
      three weeks, and that has as much effect as if one had lived three
      thousand years, and read all that was composed and written; that is what I
      say, and it is right. I have seen everything and I know everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poesy!&rdquo; cried the learned man. &ldquo;Yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse in
      large cities! Poesy! Yes, I have seen her&mdash;a single short moment, but
      sleep came into my eyes! She stood on the balcony and shone as the Aurora
      Borealis shines. Go on, go on&mdash;thou wert on the balcony, and went
      through the doorway, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I was in the antechamber,&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;You always sat and
      looked over to the antechamber. There was no light; there was a sort of
      twilight, but the one door stood open directly opposite the other through
      a long row of rooms and saloons, and there it was lighted up. I should
      have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden; but I was
      circumspect, I took time to think, and that one must always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what didst thou then see?&rdquo; asked the learned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw everything, and I shall tell all to you: but&mdash;it is no pride
      on my part&mdash;as a free man, and with the knowledge I have, not to
      speak of my position in life, my excellent circumstances&mdash;I certainly
      wish that you would say YOU* to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      * It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the second
      person singular, &ldquo;Du,&rdquo; (thou) when speaking to each other. When a
      friendship is formed between men, they generally affirm it, when occasion
      offers, either in public or private, by drinking to each other and
      exclaiming, &ldquo;thy health,&rdquo; at the same time striking their glasses
      together. This is called drinking &ldquo;Duus&rdquo;: they are then, &ldquo;Duus Brodre,&rdquo;
       (thou brothers) and ever afterwards use the pronoun &ldquo;thou,&rdquo; to each other,
      it being regarded as more familiar than &ldquo;De,&rdquo; (you). Father and mother,
      sister and brother say thou to one another&mdash;without regard to age or
      rank. Master and mistress say thou to their servants the superior to the
      inferior. But servants and inferiors do not use the same term to their
      masters, or superiors&mdash;nor is it ever used when speaking to a
      stranger, or anyone with whom they are but slightly acquainted&mdash;they
      then say as in English&mdash;you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the learned man; &ldquo;it is an old habit with me.
      YOU are perfectly right, and I shall remember it; but now you must tell me
      all YOU saw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;For I saw everything, and I know
      everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it look in the furthest saloon?&rdquo; asked the learned man. &ldquo;Was it
      there as in the fresh woods? Was it there as in a holy church? Were the
      saloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything was there!&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;I did not go quite in, I
      remained in the foremost room, in the twilight, but I stood there quite
      well; I saw everything, and I know everything! I have been in the
      antechamber at the court of Poesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But WHAT DID you see? Did all the gods of the olden times pass through
      the large saloons? Did the old heroes combat there? Did sweet children
      play there, and relate their dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I was there, and you can conceive that I saw everything there
      was to be seen. Had you come over there, you would not have been a man;
      but I became so! And besides, I learned to know my inward nature, my
      innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the time I was
      with you, I thought not of that, but always&mdash;you know it well&mdash;when
      the sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so strangely great; in
      the moonlight I was very near being more distinct than yourself; at that
      time I did not understand my nature; it was revealed to me in the
      antechamber! I became a man! I came out matured; but you were no longer in
      the warm lands; as a man I was ashamed to go as I did. I was in want of
      boots, of clothes, of the whole human varnish that makes a man
      perceptible. I took my way&mdash;I tell it to you, but you will not put it
      in any book&mdash;I took my way to the cake woman&mdash;I hid myself
      behind her; the woman didn't think how much she concealed. I went out
      first in the evening; I ran about the streets in the moonlight; I made
      myself long up the walls&mdash;it tickles the back so delightfully! I ran
      up, and ran down, peeped into the highest windows, into the saloons, and
      on the roofs, I peeped in where no one could peep, and I saw what no one
      else saw, what no one else should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I
      would not be a man if it were not now once accepted and regarded as
      something to be so! I saw the most unimaginable things with the women,
      with the men, with parents, and with the sweet, matchless children; I
      saw,&rdquo; said the shadow, &ldquo;what no human being must know, but what they would
      all so willingly know&mdash;what is bad in their neighbor. Had I written a
      newspaper, it would have been read! But I wrote direct to the persons
      themselves, and there was consternation in all the towns where I came.
      They were so afraid of me, and yet they were so excessively fond of me.
      The professors made a professor of me; the tailors gave me new clothes&mdash;I
      am well furnished; the master of the mint struck new coin for me, and the
      women said I was so handsome! And so I became the man I am. And I now bid
      you farewell. Here is my card&mdash;I live on the sunny side of the
      street, and am always at home in rainy weather!&rdquo; And so away went the
      shadow. &ldquo;That was most extraordinary!&rdquo; said the learned man. Years and
      days passed away, then the shadow came again. &ldquo;How goes it?&rdquo; said the
      shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the learned man. &ldquo;I write about the true, and the good, and
      the beautiful, but no one cares to hear such things; I am quite desperate,
      for I take it so much to heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't!&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;I become fat, and it is that one wants to
      become! You do not understand the world. You will become ill by it. You
      must travel! I shall make a tour this summer; will you go with me? I
      should like to have a travelling companion! Will you go with me, as
      shadow? It will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me; I shall
      pay the travelling expenses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, this is too much!&rdquo; said the learned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just as one takes it!&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;It will do you much good
      to travel! Will you be my shadow? You shall have everything free on the
      journey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that is too bad!&rdquo; said the learned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is just so with the world!&rdquo; said the shadow, &ldquo;and so it will be!&rdquo;
       and away it went again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned man was not at all in the most enviable state; grief and
      torment followed him, and what he said about the true, and the good, and
      the beautiful, was, to most persons, like roses for a cow! He was quite
      ill at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really look like a shadow!&rdquo; said his friends to him; and the learned
      man trembled, for he thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go to a watering-place!&rdquo; said the shadow, who came and visited
      him. &ldquo;There is nothing else for it! I will take you with me for old
      acquaintance' sake; I will pay the travelling expenses, and you write the
      descriptions&mdash;and if they are a little amusing for me on the way! I
      will go to a watering-place&mdash;my beard does not grow out as it ought&mdash;that
      is also a sickness&mdash;and one must have a beard! Now you be wise and
      accept the offer; we shall travel as comrades!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they travelled; the shadow was master, and the master was the
      shadow; they drove with each other, they rode and walked together, side by
      side, before and behind, just as the sun was; the shadow always took care
      to keep itself in the master's place. Now the learned man didn't think
      much about that; he was a very kind-hearted man, and particularly mild and
      friendly, and so he said one day to the shadow: &ldquo;As we have now become
      companions, and in this way have grown up together from childhood, shall
      we not drink 'thou' together, it is more familiar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the shadow, who was now the proper master. &ldquo;It is
      said in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. You, as a learned
      man, certainly know how strange nature is. Some persons cannot bear to
      touch grey paper, or they become ill; others shiver in every limb if one
      rub a pane of glass with a nail: I have just such a feeling on hearing you
      say thou to me; I feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first
      situation with you. You see that it is a feeling; that it is not pride: I
      cannot allow you to say THOU to me, but I will willingly say THOU to you,
      so it is half done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the shadow said THOU to its former master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is rather too bad,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that I must say YOU and he say
      THOU,&rdquo; but he was now obliged to put up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers, and
      amongst them was a princess, who was troubled with seeing too well; and
      that was so alarming!
    </p>
    <p>
      She directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a
      different sort of person to all the others; &ldquo;He has come here in order to
      get his beard to grow, they say, but I see the real cause, he cannot cast
      a shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had become inquisitive; and so she entered into conversation directly
      with the strange gentleman, on their promenades. As the daughter of a
      king, she needed not to stand upon trifles, so she said, &ldquo;Your complaint
      is, that you cannot cast a shadow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Royal Highness must be improving considerably,&rdquo; said the shadow, &ldquo;I
      know your complaint is, that you see too clearly, but it has decreased,
      you are cured. I just happen to have a very unusual shadow! Do you not see
      that person who always goes with me? Other persons have a common shadow,
      but I do not like what is common to all. We give our servants finer cloth
      for their livery than we ourselves use, and so I had my shadow trimmed up
      into a man: yes, you see I have even given him a shadow. It is somewhat
      expensive, but I like to have something for myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; thought the princess. &ldquo;Should I really be cured! These baths are
      the first in the world! In our time water has wonderful powers. But I
      shall not leave the place, for it now begins to be amusing here. I am
      extremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow, for
      in that case he will leave us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the large
      ball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had never had such
      a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she came, and he knew
      that land; he had been there, but then she was not at home; he had peeped
      in at the window, above and below&mdash;he had seen both the one and the
      other, and so he could answer the princess, and make insinuations, so that
      she was quite astonished; he must be the wisest man in the whole world!
      She felt such respect for what he knew! So that when they again danced
      together she fell in love with him; and that the shadow could remark, for
      she almost pierced him through with her eyes. So they danced once more
      together; and she was about to declare herself, but she was discreet; she
      thought of her country and kingdom, and of the many persons she would have
      to reign over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a wise man,&rdquo; said she to herself&mdash;&ldquo;It is well; and he dances
      delightfully&mdash;that is also good; but has he solid knowledge? That is
      just as important! He must be examined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult things
      she could think of, and which she herself could not have answered; so that
      the shadow made a strange face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot answer these questions?&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to my childhood's learning,&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;I really
      believe my shadow, by the door there, can answer them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your shadow!&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;That would indeed be marvellous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not say for a certainty that he can,&rdquo; said the shadow, &ldquo;but I
      think so; he has now followed me for so many years, and listened to my
      conversation&mdash;I should think it possible. But your royal highness
      will permit me to observe, that he is so proud of passing himself off for
      a man, that when he is to be in a proper humor&mdash;and he must be so to
      answer well&mdash;he must be treated quite like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I like that!&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went to the learned man by the door, and she spoke to him about the
      sun and the moon, and about persons out of and in the world, and he
      answered with wisdom and prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;It will
      be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if I choose him for my consort&mdash;I
      will do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were soon agreed, both the princess and the shadow; but no one was to
      know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one&mdash;not even my shadow!&rdquo; said the shadow, and he had his own
      thoughts about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my good friend,&rdquo; said the shadow to the learned man. &ldquo;I have now
      become as happy and mighty as anyone can be; I will, therefore, do
      something particular for thee! Thou shalt always live with me in the
      palace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have ten thousand pounds a
      year; but then thou must submit to be called SHADOW by all and everyone;
      thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man; and once a year, when I
      sit on the balcony in the sunshine, thou must lie at my feet, as a shadow
      shall do! I must tell thee: I am going to marry the king's daughter, and
      the nuptials are to take place this evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, this is going too far!&rdquo; said the learned man. &ldquo;I will not have it; I
      will not do it! It is to deceive the whole country and the princess too! I
      will tell everything! That I am a man, and that thou art a shadow&mdash;thou
      art only dressed up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one who will believe it!&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;Be reasonable, or
      I will call the guard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go directly to the princess!&rdquo; said the learned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will go first!&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;And thou wilt go to prison!&rdquo; and
      that he was obliged to do&mdash;for the sentinels obeyed him whom they
      knew the king's daughter was to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tremble!&rdquo; said the princess, as the shadow came into her chamber.
      &ldquo;Has anything happened? You must not be unwell this evening, now that we
      are to have our nuptials celebrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived to see the most cruel thing that anyone can live to see!&rdquo;
       said the shadow. &ldquo;Only imagine&mdash;yes, it is true, such a poor
      shadow-skull cannot bear much&mdash;only think, my shadow has become mad;
      he thinks that he is a man, and that I&mdash;now only think&mdash;that I
      am his shadow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is terrible!&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;but he is confined, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is. I am afraid that he will never recover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor shadow!&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;He is very unfortunate; it would be a
      real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has, and, when
      I think properly over the matter, I am of opinion that it will be
      necessary to do away with him in all stillness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly hard,&rdquo; said the shadow, &ldquo;for he was a faithful servant!&rdquo;
       and then he gave a sort of sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a noble character!&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole city was illuminated in the evening, and the cannons went off
      with a bum! bum! and the soldiers presented arms. That was a marriage! The
      princess and the shadow went out on the balcony to show themselves, and
      get another hurrah!
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned man heard nothing of all this&mdash;for they had deprived him
      of life.

    <h2>
      THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and
      evening&mdash;the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness
      there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked
      feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the
      good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto
      worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she
      scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by
      dreadfully fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an
      urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a
      cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the
      little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and
      blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she
      held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the
      whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crept along trembling with cold and hunger&mdash;a very picture of
      sorrow, the poor little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful
      curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought.
      From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so
      deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of
      that she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the
      other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she
      had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home
      she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring
      a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at
      home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which
      the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with
      straw and rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford
      her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the
      bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one
      out. &ldquo;Rischt!&rdquo; how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame,
      like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It
      seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a
      large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top.
      The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully.
      The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but&mdash;the
      small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the
      burnt-out match in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the
      light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so
      that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white
      tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose
      was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what
      was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish,
      reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came
      up to the poor little girl; when&mdash;the match went out and nothing but
      the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now
      there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was
      still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through
      the glass door in the rich merchant's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored
      pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her.
      The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when&mdash;the
      match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher,
      she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail
      of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone is just dead!&rdquo; said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the
      only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that
      when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the
      lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild,
      and with such an expression of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother!&rdquo; cried the little one. &ldquo;Oh, take me with you! You go away
      when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the
      delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!&rdquo; And she
      rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she
      wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the
      matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day:
      never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took
      the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so
      high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor
      anxiety&mdash;they were with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy
      cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall&mdash;frozen to
      death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child
      there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. &ldquo;She wanted to
      warm herself,&rdquo; people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what
      beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in
      which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.

    <h2>
      THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that
      was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for
      Charles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it. He had now to
      take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much younger than himself,
      and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but these two
      things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little fellow,
      with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he knew; and
      he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book that lay
      open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt all the towns
      in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is possible to be
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta on
      her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he pretty
      nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his mother had
      no money to buy a candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes the old washerwoman over the way,&rdquo; said his mother, as she
      looked out of the window. &ldquo;The poor woman can hardly drag herself along,
      and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. Be a good boy,
      Tukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into
      the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of
      such a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead;
      in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and
      of all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read
      over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore
      put his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was a
      very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one
      cannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well, there he lay, and thought
      and thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes and
      mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old
      washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, &ldquo;It were a great sin
      if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided me, I
      therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all times.&rdquo;
       And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping and
      scratching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!&rdquo;&mdash;that was an old hen who came
      creeping along, and she was from Kjoge. &ldquo;I am a Kjoger hen,&rdquo; [*] said she,
      and then she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the
      battle that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth
      talking about.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Kjoge, a town in the bay of Kjoge. &ldquo;To see the Kjoge
     hens,&rdquo; is an expression similar to &ldquo;showing a child London,&rdquo;
      which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands,
     and so lifting him off the ground. At the invasion of the
     English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature
     took place between the British troops and the undisciplined
     Danish militia.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kribledy, krabledy&mdash;plump!&rdquo; down fell somebody: it was a wooden
      bird, the popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now he said
      that there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and
      he was very proud. &ldquo;Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* Plump! Here
      I lie capitally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      * Prastoe, a still smaller town than Kjoge. Some hundred paces from it
      lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen, the famed sculptor,
      generally sojourned during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many
      of his immortal works into existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on horseback.
      On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A knight with a
      gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him before him on the
      horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old town of Bordingborg,
      and that was a large and very lively town. High towers rose from the
      castle of the king, and the brightness of many candles streamed from all
      the windows; within was dance and song, and King Waldemar and the young,
      richly-attired maids of honor danced together. The morn now came; and as
      soon as the sun appeared, the whole town and the king's palace crumbled
      together, and one tower after the other; and at last only a single one
      remained standing where the castle had been before,* and the town was so
      small and poor, and the school boys came along with their books under
      their arms, and said, &ldquo;2000 inhabitants!&rdquo; but that was not true, for there
      were not so many.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Bordingborg, in the reign of King Waldemar, a considerable place, now an
      unimportant little town. One solitary tower only, and some remains of a
      wall, show where the castle once stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And little Tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed, and
      yet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Tukey! Little Tukey!&rdquo; cried someone near. It was a seaman, quite a
      little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a midshipman
      it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many remembrances from Corsor.* That is a town that is just rising into
      importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches: formerly
      people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on the sea,&rdquo; said
      Corsor; &ldquo;I have high roads and gardens, and I have given birth to a poet
      who was witty and amusing, which all poets are not. I once intended to
      equip a ship that was to sail all round the earth; but I did not do it,
      although I could have done so: and then, too, I smell so deliciously, for
      close before the gate bloom the most beautiful roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      *Corsor, on the Great Belt, called, formerly, before the introduction of
      steam-vessels, when travellers were often obliged to wait a long time for
      a favorable wind, &ldquo;the most tiresome of towns.&rdquo; The poet Baggesen was born
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as soon
      as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden there
      appeared a wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above stood a
      magnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out the
      hill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that there was a
      continual splashing; and close beside them sat an old king with a golden
      crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the fountains, close
      to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up the slope into the
      old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark, hand in hand, all
      with their golden crowns; and the organ played and the fountains rustled.
      Little Tuk saw all, heard all. &ldquo;Do not forget the diet,&rdquo; said King Hroar.*
    </p>
    <p>
      *Roeskilde, once the capital of Denmark. The town takes its name from King
      Hroar, and the many fountains in the neighborhood. In the beautiful
      cathedral the greater number of the kings and queens of Denmark are
      interred. In Roeskilde, too, the members of the Danish Diet assemble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him just as
      if one turned over a leaf in a book. And now stood there an old
      peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,* where grass grows in the
      market-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and
      back: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. &ldquo;Yes, that it
      has,&rdquo; said she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's
      comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered
      together, and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she
      looked as she were going to make a spring. &ldquo;Croak! croak!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It
      is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in Sorbe!&rdquo;
       She was now suddenly a frog, &ldquo;Croak&rdquo;; and now she was an old woman. &ldquo;One
      must dress according to the weather,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is wet; it is wet. My
      town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck, and by the neck
      one must get out again! In former times I had the finest fish, and now I
      have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the bottle, who learn
      wisdom, Hebrew, Greek&mdash;Croak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      * Sorbe, a very quiet little town, beautifully situated, surrounded by
      woods and lakes. Holberg, Denmark's Moliere, founded here an academy for
      the sons of the nobles. The poets Hauch and Ingemann were appointed
      professors here. The latter lives there still.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one
      walked with great boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform and
      so tiring that little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which, by the bye,
      could not do him any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was: his
      little sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair,
      was suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings was yet able
      to fly; and she now flew over Zealand&mdash;over the green woods and the
      blue lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks are flying
      up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so very large! You
      will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! You will get on in the world! You
      will be a rich and happy man! Your house will exalt itself like King
      Waldemar's tower, and will be richly decorated with marble statues, like
      that at Prastoe. You understand what I mean. Your name shall circulate
      with renown all round the earth, like unto the ship that was to have
      sailed from Corsor; and in Roeskilde&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget the diet!&rdquo; said King Hroar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at last you
      sink into your grave, you shall sleep as quietly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I lay in Soroe,&rdquo; said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he was
      now quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was not at all
      necessary, for one may not know what the future will bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And out of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at once he
      knew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped her head in at the
      door, nodded to him friendly, and said, &ldquo;Thanks, many thanks, my good
      child, for your help! May the good ever-loving God fulfil your loveliest
      dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the loving God
      knew it.

      THE NAUGHTY BOY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Along time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet. As he
      was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without, and
      the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old poet sat warm and
      comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the roasting
      apple hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin,&rdquo;
       said the good old poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!&rdquo; exclaimed suddenly a
      child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while the
      rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; said the old poet, as he went to open the door. There stood
      a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long golden
      hair; he trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room he would
      most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand. &ldquo;Come in,
      come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and roasted
      apples, for thou art verily a charming child!&rdquo; And the boy was so really.
      His eyes were like two bright stars; and although the water trickled down
      his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly like a little
      angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled with cold. He had a
      nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite spoiled by the rain, and the
      tints of his many-colored arrows ran one into the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little fellow
      on his lap; he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair, warmed his
      hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine. Then the boy
      recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from the lap where
      he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a merry fellow,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Cupid,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;Don't you know me? There lies my
      bow; it shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing
      up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your bow is quite spoiled,&rdquo; said the old poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were sad indeed,&rdquo; said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand and
      examined it on every side. &ldquo;Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at all;
      the string is quite tight. I will try it directly.&rdquo; And he bent his bow,
      took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart. &ldquo;You
      see now that my bow was not spoiled,&rdquo; said he laughing; and away he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      The naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way; he who had taken him
      into his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him
      warm wine and the very best apples!
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown
      into his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children
      about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will only
      cause them sorrow and many a heartache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed of
      this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is
      astonishingly cunning. When the university students come from the
      lectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his
      arm. It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along with
      him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves; and then,
      unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom. When the young maidens
      come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to be
      confirmed, there he is again close behind them. Yes, he is forever
      following people. At the play, he sits in the great chandelier and burns
      in bright flames, so that people think it is really a flame, but they soon
      discover it is something else. He roves about in the garden of the palace
      and upon the ramparts: yes, once he even shot your father and mother right
      in the heart. Ask them only and you will hear what they'll tell you. Oh,
      he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have anything to do with
      him. He is forever running after everybody. Only think, he shot an arrow
      once at your old grandmother! But that is a long time ago, and it is all
      past now; however, a thing of that sort she never forgets. Fie, naughty
      Cupid! But now you know him, and you know, too, how ill-behaved he is!

    <h2>
      THE RED SHOES
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in
      summer she was forced to run about with bare feet, she was so poor, and in
      winter wear very large wooden shoes, which made her little insteps quite
      red, and that looked so dangerous!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sat and sewed
      together, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of old red
      strips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought. They
      were meant for the little girl. The little girl was called Karen.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes, and
      wore them for the first time. They were certainly not intended for
      mourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she followed
      the poor straw coffin in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a large old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it:
      she looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to
      the clergyman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, give me the little girl. I will adopt her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but the
      old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But Karen
      herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew;
      and people said she was a nice little thing, but the looking-glass said:
      &ldquo;Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little
      daughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people
      streamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little princess
      stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be stared at;
      she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid red morocco
      shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame Shoemaker had
      made for little Karen. Nothing in the world can be compared with red
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was to
      have new shoes also. The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of
      her little foot. This took place at his house, in his room; where stood
      large glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. All this
      looked charming, but the old lady could not see well, and so had no
      pleasure in them. In the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones, just
      like those the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! The shoemaker
      said also they had been made for the child of a count, but had not fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be patent leather!&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;They shine so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they shine!&rdquo; said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but the
      old lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never have
      allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. Yet such was the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel
      door on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on the
      tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with stiff
      ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red shoes. And she
      thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head, and
      spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how she should be
      now a matured Christian; and the organ pealed so solemnly; the sweet
      children's voices sang, and the old music-directors sang, but Karen only
      thought of her red shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had been
      red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was not at all
      becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes to
      church, even when she should be older.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black
      shoes, looked at the red ones&mdash;looked at them again, and put on the
      red shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path
      through the corn; it was rather dusty there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a
      wonderfully long beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to the
      ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes. And Karen
      stretched out her little foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, what beautiful dancing shoes!&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;Sit firm when you
      dance&rdquo;; and he put his hand out towards the soles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church with
      Karen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the
      pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised the cup to her
      lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to swim in it;
      and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray, &ldquo;Our Father in
      Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now all the people went out of church, and the old lady got into her
      carriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old soldier
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her
      feet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power over
      them. She danced round the church corner, she could not leave off; the
      coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and he lifted her
      in the carriage, but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on the
      old lady dreadfully. At length she took the shoes off, and then her legs
      had peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not avoid
      looking at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the old lady was sick, and it was said she could not recover. She must
      be nursed and waited upon, and there was no one whose duty it was so much
      as Karen's. But there was a great ball in the city, to which Karen was
      invited. She looked at the old lady, who could not recover, she looked at
      the red shoes, and she thought there could be no sin in it; she put on the
      red shoes, she might do that also, she thought. But then she went to the
      ball and began to dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to the left,
      and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced back again,
      down the steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She danced, and
      was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it must be
      the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier with the red
      beard; he sat there, nodded his head, and said, &ldquo;Look, what beautiful
      dancing shoes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but they
      clung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes seemed to
      have grown to her feet. And she danced, and must dance, over fields and
      meadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day; but at night it was the
      most fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance&mdash;they had
      something better to do than to dance. She wished to seat herself on a poor
      man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for her there was neither
      peace nor rest; and when she danced towards the open church door, she saw
      an angel standing there. He wore long, white garments; he had wings which
      reached from his shoulders to the earth; his countenance was severe and
      grave; and in his hand he held a sword, broad and glittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dance shalt thou!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Dance in thy red shoes till thou art pale
      and cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! Dance shalt
      thou from door to door, and where proud, vain children dwell, thou shalt
      knock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance shalt thou&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried Karen. But she did not hear the angel's reply, for the
      shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and
      bridges, and she must keep ever dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded a
      psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew that
      the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all, and
      condemned by the angel of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      She danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. The
      shoes carried her over stack and stone; she was torn till she bled; she
      danced over the heath till she came to a little house. Here, she knew,
      dwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her fingers at the window, and
      said, &ldquo;Come out! Come out! I cannot come in, for I am forced to dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the executioner said, &ldquo;Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy? I strike
      bad people's heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't strike my head off!&rdquo; said Karen. &ldquo;Then I can't repent of my sins!
      But strike off my feet in the red shoes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off her
      feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little feet
      across the field into the deep wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught her the
      psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had wielded the
      axe, and went over the heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now I will go
      into the church that people may see me!&rdquo; And she hastened towards the
      church door: but when she was near it, the red shoes danced before her,
      and she was terrified, and turned round. The whole week she was unhappy,
      and wept many bitter tears; but when Sunday returned, she said, &ldquo;Well, now
      I have suffered and struggled enough! I really believe I am as good as
      many a one who sits in the church, and holds her head so high!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And away she went boldly; but she had not got farther than the churchyard
      gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her; and she was
      frightened, and turned back, and repented of her sin from her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went to the parsonage, and begged that they would take her into
      service; she would be very industrious, she said, and would do everything
      she could; she did not care about the wages, only she wished to have a
      home, and be with good people. And the clergyman's wife was sorry for her
      and took her into service; and she was industrious and thoughtful. She sat
      still and listened when the clergyman read the Bible in the evenings. All
      the children thought a great deal of her; but when they spoke of dress,
      and grandeur, and beauty, she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Sunday, when the family was going to church, they asked her
      whether she would not go with them; but she glanced sorrowfully, with
      tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the word of
      God; but she went alone into her little chamber; there was only room for a
      bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sat down with her Prayer-Book;
      and whilst she read with a pious mind, the wind bore the strains of the
      organ towards her, and she raised her tearful countenance, and said, &ldquo;O
      God, help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sun shone so clearly, and straight before her stood the angel of
      God in white garments, the same she had seen that night at the church
      door; but he no longer carried the sharp sword, but in its stead a
      splendid green spray, full of roses. And he touched the ceiling with the
      spray, and the ceiling rose so high, and where he had touched it there
      gleamed a golden star. And he touched the walls, and they widened out, and
      she saw the organ which was playing; she saw the old pictures of the
      preachers and the preachers' wives. The congregation sat in cushioned
      seats, and sang out of their Prayer-Books. For the church itself had come
      to the poor girl in her narrow chamber, or else she had come into the
      church. She sat in the pew with the clergyman's family, and when they had
      ended the psalm and looked up, they nodded and said, &ldquo;It is right that
      thou art come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was through mercy!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the organ pealed, and the children's voices in the choir sounded so
      sweet and soft! The clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window
      into the pew where Karen sat! Her heart was so full of sunshine, peace,
      and joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunshine to God, and there no
      one asked after the RED SHOES.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
